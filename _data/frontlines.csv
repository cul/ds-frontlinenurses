n01,Christiana B. Massally,Christiana,B,Massally,Jennifer Dohrn,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"Registrar, Sierra Leone Nurses and Midwives Board","Christiana Massally serves as the Registrar of the Sierra Leone Nurses and Midwives Board. During the Ebola outbreak, Massally was the Principal Public Health Sister for Western Area (the Freetown Peninsula), a position she held from 2010. Prior to that, Massally worked as a Head Sister in the Pujehun District.",Q: How did you first learn about Ebola? Can you tell me how you first even knew what it was?,"CM: It was May 23 when we heard that Ebola had struck Kailahun. There was a case in Kailahun, and people have started dying. We thought this was far away from us. But my friend, a public health doctor, used to joke “Sister, get ready, because if Ebola struck Freetown, you would be overwhelmed.” I said, “Doctor, it will not reach here. It is far away in Kailahun. This will not come to Freetown.” Little did we know that people were moving. No movement was restricted. So, alas, a case came into Freetown.",,,,,Q: Do you remember the first person you actually saw that was—do you remember that? Can you tell me about that?,"CM: We had one affected CHO in Waterloo. He died on October 12, 2014. I feel guilty. One Sunday after work, I went home. Just as I was about to go to bed, he called me, and said, “Sister, I am not well.” ","So I asked him. I said, “Joshua, what is wrong with you?” He said, “Sister, I think this is part of the big sickness.” And I said, “No, no, no, Joshua. It can’t be that. Maybe you are suffering from malaria.” ","“When I am suffering from malaria, you used to treat me.” ","“Let me explain what medicine you should take.” That was Sunday night. I told him what to do. On Monday and Tuesday, he was being harassed by some political people in Waterloo. He was taken to a cell. By Wednesday, when Concern was having training for CHOs, all the CHOs went on strike in Waterloo to help Joshua. You know what happened? Thursday morning, I went to work, and I was told that Joshua had Ebola. ",We took Joshua. We brought him to Connaught Hospital. They tested him. He was positive. They took him to the treatment center in Jui. That was where he died. He was a community health officer. He was in charge of Luawa. ,"That’s a senior community health officer who was in charge of Luawa, sensitizing people, raising their awareness, what they should do and what they should not do, as far as Ebola is concerned. He died. ","Q: How did your family—what did they go through, watching you?","CM: When I come home every evening, I bathe outside. I put everything in a new plastic bag. Nobody will touch it. I put everything in a new plastic bag. I leave my boots in my office. I will not bring these home. I leave everything outside when I come home from work and I bathe outside. I would not allow my kids to touch me. Thank God they were grown up. They were all at Komas when they saw this, so they know how to prevent themselves. My husband would pray to God for me every morning. ",,,"Q: So when the country was declared Ebola-free, what were the consequences for nurses to recover from this trauma, for the effect on the healthcare system?","CM: We lost so many nurses. So we had—it was not just the responsibility of the director of nursing to post other nurses to those places where we lost those health workers. The nurses, they felt a little bit frustrated, because with all the work that we did, we were not really recognized as people that have worked. We were not recognized. ","It’s the nurses that—we render nursing care. A doctor will not render nursing care, but a nurse. No other health worker will render nursing care. It is only, solely nursing care. And so many of them died. At times, I want to shout, to say, “Oh, God, we’ve gone through the war, we’ve gone through this Ebola, we’ve gone through this mudslide.” I am losing my temper very quickly. ","It was not an easy task for us. It wasn’t easy because there was too much to do. It would take me days, and I would be here for the whole day and night without any sleep. Thank God I worked at the intensive care unit, so I’ve been used to working like that. ",I think nurses need to be recognized. We need to be recognized. We played an important role as far as Ebola is concerned. We played our own part as nurses. ,"We would have loved to hear from all the districts, “Sister, how is it?” For what we went through, it was not an easy task for us. But we consider ourselves, and we have continued to serve the nation, because this is our country. It was not easy. It was not easy. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A_13c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n02,Darboi G. Korkoyah,Darboi,G.,Korkoyah,Annette Mwansa Nkowane,15-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,"Monitoring and Evaluation Director, Liberian Board for Nursing and Midwifery","Darboi Korkoyah, a Registered Nurse and graduate of the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts, is the Director of Monitoring and Evaluation of the Liberian Board for Nursing and Midwifery. Previously, Korkoyah has worked with Médecins Sans Frontières, at ELWA Hospital and at John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia. Korkoyah is a nurse educator who has taught at numerous institutions including United Methodist University and the Esther Bacon School of Nursing and Midwifery.",Q: So how did you get involved?,"DGK: I got involved through the Ministry of Health in the Liberian Board for Nursing & Midwifery. We were contacted that Ebola is on the rampage. What can we do as regulators? My boss, Miss Cecelia Morris said we are educated nurses, and to practice and train the midwives and other nurses. The quality of care could prevent Ebola. The World Health Organization assigned us to be trainers during Ebola.  After that training, we were able to roll down the training to nurses and midwives in the fifteen counties in Liberia.",,,,,Q: What were you using to train?  What guidance were you basing your training on?,"DGK: We were basing our training specifically on IPC, infection prevention and control. So we taught on PPE [personal protective equipment]. We taught on how to fix [phonetic] chlorine solution, how to disinfect the infected material or equipment and supply that were being used by nurses, how to get rid of contaminated material. Those were training that were provided for our nurses, basically, especially for midwivesfe. The enhanced PPE: when you are going into the delivery ward, you need to dress in your complete, enhanced PPE in order to face your client. And they were trained that when there is no PPE you should not take the risk. You have to protect yourself before protecting another person during the Ebola, because you cannot expose yourself. If you expose yourself, you wouldn’t be able to provide the care to the client.","Ebola was very devastating. Nurses died [phonetic]. You could see people were leaving from here, going home, dead bodies upon dead bodies. Dead bodies. And nurses were not given dignified burial.",,,,,Q: What do you mean?,"DGK: They are buried there in a mass grave, whereas doctors were given specific preference to be buried to where their relative can identify their grave. But it was not done in nurses’ case.",,,"Q: So what you are saying is that doctors were buried in single graves, while nurses were put in mass—","DGK: Some doctors were buried in single graves, while nurses were buried in a mass grave.",,,,,,,Q: Did you witness any of those burials?,"DGK: No. But no matter what, we look together as a team to keep the profession moving. They say, “Keep safe, keep saving. Keep safe and keep saving.” The dead are already gone. Ebola has two symptoms: the dry symptoms and the wet symptoms. So once you die, they spray you with chlorine, so you don’t come in contact with the fluid. Today, some people cannot even identify their loved ones’ graves.",,,,"Q: So how was that, dealing with that in the family?","DGK: Oh, it was very bad. Families grieve. Families cry. Korto even called me many for many days.  With my nursing background, I said, “No, Korto, that’s the aftermath of the Ebola. It can even get you blind. It gets you confused. But with time, you will heal.” ",,,,,,Q: And what do you think of the old habits that have gone and the new policies that have been adapted since Ebola?,"DGK: During the outbreak, policies were not available. Policies were not given to nurses. They did not know where to go, how to channel their grievances. But now, at certain level, policies are there. The IPC policy, I participated in the dissemination that was helped by WHO. Or the policy is there, but are there monitoring systems? No. Now, if we just leave from here to go to one health facility, you will see there will be handwashing bucket but no water, no soap. Are we going back to the same old thing? We will get back there. If there is a monitoring system in place, quality assurance, people ensuring that handwashing, IPC policies are being implemented, I think the spread of infection will reduce to a greater extent. Ebola opened our eyes. It taught us how to take care of ourselves, how to encounter strangers, how to deal with people. It provided a vast opportunity to just read and be enlightened with new knowledge and skills. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n03,Dolphine Buoga,Dolphine,,Buoga,Jennifer Dohrn,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"Nursing and Midwifery Services Education Manager, ICAP Sierra Leone","Dolphine Buoga is the Nursing and Midwifery Services Education Manager for ICAP Sierra Leone, a position she has held since 2017. Buoga, originally from Kenya, came to Sierra Leone in 2014 with the International Rescue Committee and worked during the Ebola crisis in an isolation unit. Buoga holds a BA in nursing and a masters in public health with a focus on epidemiology.",Q: What is your country of origin?,"DB:  I’m a Kenyan and I’m a nurse/midwife. I have a Bachelor’s degree in nursing, and a Master’s of public health, epidemiology. That’s the sequence that made me come to Sierra Leone.",,,,,Q: Why did you become a nurse?,"DB: I grew up in a village. My family was poor, and, of course, poverty comes with a lot of childhood illnesses. Most of the time my mother could take us to the nearest dispensary. Unfortunately, my younger sister was born with cerebral palsy, and cerebral palsy has a lot of medical issues. One day you are stable; one day you’re not. I would accompany my mother to the hospital because as children living in poverty we were often falling ill. ","One of the nurses was very neat, very clean, with nice, combed hair. She wore a white dress, was very organized, and gave us the best treatment. She also gave us clean water. Basically, I admired her lifestyle and the way she used to handle us. I used to tell my mother, “One day I want to be like this lady.” She was not actually a nurse. At the village level, there were nursing aides at the village level, paramedics, but that’s what inspired me to enter the medical profession.  ",,,,,Q: When did you first hear of Ebola?,"DB: I actually studied Ebola when I was at the university, and hemorrhagic viral diseases. It was just one of the diseases, something that we had heard about; that it had occurred in Kenya and in DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo], Congo, Uganda. The outbreak in 2014 made me see it in a real life situation. ",,,"Q: Tell me a little bit about when you came to Sierra Leone to work with ICAP here, what the state of the Ebola outbreak was.","DB: In 2014, I was working for CDC [Centers for Disease Control] Nairobi. One day, when I opened my computer I saw jobs popping up. I thought, ah, these are things I’m qualified for on a website with International Rescue Committee. I sent my CV [curriculum vitae] immediately, and within three hours they got back to me. They said okay and quickly organized for an interview. I told them I’d been working with CDC on various projects: sentinel surveillance, infection prevention and control, amongst other projects, and with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus]. ","I was interviewed, and then after twenty minutes they sent me an email saying that I was successful. It was so rapid! I informed my family, there was a lot of resistance, but now that’s history.","People were being trained for three days; me, I got trained for six hours, because I already understood the concepts. The following day I went to Bo. The situation there was pathetic. Very few health personnel. People were dying, an ambulance could come with eight suspected cases. ","I was in an isolation unit, where you get the people from the community. It was like a holding unit. You first do first aid treatment. You take the sample results. You take them for testing. It would take seventy-two hours before the test results came out. We would do the conservative treatments, hydration, antipyretics, antimalarials. We were giving ciprofloxacin, quantum, ORS [oral rehydration solution], normal saline, all these things, as we waited for the results. The assignment I was given was to train nurses how to don and doff, but at times I was also engaged in patient care in the isolation unit. ","Once we confirmed a case as Ebola, we transferred the patient to the treatment center. But it was also an interesting experience because you saw human beings dying like houseflies. It was actually the first time I ever saw somebody bleeding from the eyes, the skin. You see, it was like a movie, because these are things you read about in the books, and you don’t imagine they can occur in human beings. And I saw them in real life.",,,Q: Can you talk about the relationship between nurses and the community during the rising part of Ebola?,"DB: Basically, there was this myth that it was the responsibility of the nurses, that the nurses were infecting people in the community. They became victims of circumstance. At some point it reduced, because people understood what Ebola was. Remember, this was something that rapidly came into the country, killing people en masse, and the deaths were so sudden. You know, usually there are a lot of myths when certain disasters come into the country. People come with a lot of theories to explain the cause. ",,,,"Q: Would you describe in your own development, and then certainly the work forced on Ebola here, and IPC, the role of gender, of women. Do you see any particular connection, or reasons of how we draw our own strength?","DB: Yes, sure. Actually, women are resilient. It doesn’t matter what comes their way, they always stand on their feet. We are also responsible. You see, as a woman, you know the physiology of labor, what you go through and the process of childbearing, unlike men. ","Okay? I’m not being a female chauvinist, but that is what makes us different, anyway. But yes, women played an important role, actually taking care of the children in the isolation unit. And basically, most of the people being deployed were women, because they were the nurses. We also had male nurses, but very few. Being a woman, you are professional, you are resilient, and you have what it takes to ensure somebody gets his life back and is comfortable. ",,,,,"Q: Is there anything, just from your own observations, that you would recommend? Lessons you learned from Ebola? Anything else that’s particularly focused on nursing?","DB: I would prefer the leadership of the country to take some affirmative action, because basically—I won’t say indiscipline, but there’s a lot of impunity in this country. People do things, and they walk away with it. Because, like in my country, you know you are conducting delivery. What are you supposed to have? Why don’t you put it—? That alone is for you to be punished, because you know once you get an infection chances are highly likely you will infect the other staff. Okay? And, again, on the national grid, if you are sick you will be admitted, and you are now costing economically. You are costing the government. How much money will be spent on you when you are sick? Less workforce, because when you are off there is nobody to replace you. We need to have some affirmative action and discipline. If you make a mistake, at least you need to be corrected for whatever you’ve done. We give hand sanitizer. Some of them carry it home. You are given cleaning materials; you don’t clean properly or use the materials for cleaning. A lot of shortcuts. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n04,Elizabeth K. Lemor,Elizabeth,K,Lemor,Annette Mwansa Nkowane,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"Nurse Midwife; Directorate of Training, Human Resources Department, Sierra Leone Ministry of Health","Elizabeth Lemor has worked as a nurse midwife since 1990. During the Ebola epidemic, Lemor worked for the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health in the Human Resource Department of the Attendance Monitoring Bureau. Previously, Lemor had worked at Ola During Children's Hospital and Kenema Government Hospital.",Q: Where were you working during the Ebola crisis? How did you become a nurse?,"EKL: I was working for the Human Resource Department at the Attendance Monitoring Unit, Bureau Unit. A friend told me that there was a school offering nursing school almost for free and would also give you lodging. I enrolled to do SRN [State Registered Nurse] in 1987. When I graduated in 1989, I was posted to the Ola During Children’s Hospital, and I went for midwifery training. ","After the midwifery, I was reposted to Children’s Hospital, and I brought my son to be with me. We relocated to Kenema, and that was when the Rebel War became intensified around the surroundings of Kenema and even in Kenema. By then, life was not really easy. Seeing the people displaced that came back. All my mother’s family members were staying with us in the same house, so the meager resources we were getting were not enough to take care of the people around us. We had to make do with whatever was available. ","I was working in Kenema Government Hospital and was assigned to one of the wards that the wounded soldiers were admitted to. It was really stressful because every day they would bring somebody that had been injured, or somebody that had been killed in the war.",,,"Q: When did you learn about Ebola, and what was your experience?","EKL: I think Ebola came in March 2013 or so, and I went on a monitoring tour in Kenema. That was when I heard that a fever was killing people in Kailahun, and we thought it was Lhasa, it will pass. When I came back to Freetown, I heard the news that it wasn’t Lhasa, it was Ebola. But before it was declared Ebola, we gave it all sorts of names. We knew the Ministry was preparing for some kind of epidemic. But health workers were thinking, it’s fever, it’s headache, and other complications of malaria, so maybe it’s malaria. Nobody thought it was its own thing. ","The first case came from Kailahun to Kenema, where many health workers had been infected and some had died. In Kenema, I got involved with Ebola when one of the health workers came to the office for an inter-district transfer. He wanted an annual leave, because he thought it was time. I told him, “You know, they say it’s Ebola, so can you please stand off my table so that we can talk? You don’t need to be so close to me.” And he said, “Sister, I’m not from where the Ebola is.” I said, “I know, but we have to start to keep precaution and other things.”","He laughed and left for Cameroon. Then the message came that they were looking for him, that he was one of the suspects they are looking for. He was captured in Cameroon and taken back to Kenema, into the ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit]. We had been thinking that Ebola was far off. Then we knew that Ebola could easily come to Freetown. ","The news about colleagues falling down with Ebola, getting ill, came. Many nurses had died. Even in Kenema, the population was rejecting health workers because they were thought to be lying. They were accused of saying “it’s Ebola,” but when people came for treatment, they would inject them and make them die. The health workers started leaving the workplace because of the stigmas and everything attached to them. ",,,"Q: What was the proudest thing you did? You know, if you look back and say, oh, but even in this confusion I did something.","EKL: The proudest thing I did was participating in the training. When we were developing the models for treatment, people from WHO would insist that we not touch the patient, that you should keep an arm’s-length distance between you and the patient. I said, “Then why are we bringing them into hospitals? Because if we are not going to touch them and we are protecting ourselves, the one thing that is always critical in nursing care is that in nursing you touch. We should devise a way so that even if you touch you are protected.” ","There is no human who is going to come close to the other who will not touch, and we had the culture of touching. That was how we changed most of the protocols to adapt to our cultural settings, where at least you will not go and see a patient struggling and not help. At least you will take water and give it to the person to drink, and not leave the person to say, “Get up and take water,” because if you are really sick you will not even get up to take water.  With us there was someone who would take it and give it to you to drink.","We had to cry out for nurses to say, “Listen, this is not right. Even the protective gear isn’t enough.” They were listening to me, to us, even during the lockdown. We participated in the lockdown, we visited people and assisted. Those are the things we are proud of that we did as a country. At least we joined hands to fight Ebola.","Q: So what can you tell us in terms of what you’ve experienced? What lessons have you learned, and what advice can you give if there’s another outbreak? How do you think we should be ready for that?","EKL: We need to strengthen the health system, but even the strengthening that Sierra Leone did was not enough, because when you strengthen the health system, for most of our colleagues or most of us working,…we don’t have the equipment and the facility to work in. And working in this part of the country as a nurse is the most deplorable [phonetic] profession in healthcare that you can go into, because nursing can be the least recognized profession in healthcare in Sierra Leone now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n05,Fatmata Kargbo,Fatmata,,Kargbo,Annette Mwansa Nkowane,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"Matron, Ola During Children's Hospital","Fatmata Kargbo, BSc is a nurse midwife. Kargbo served as a staff nurse at Connaught Hospital before being promoted to acting matron. Kargbo currently works at Ola During Children's Hospital as a matron.","Q: What led you into this field, into doing nursing and midwifery?","FK: I had passion for human beings in general, coupled up with the way the nurses carried themselves. While in school, I went to the hospital one day and saw a staff nurse in an immaculate white uniform with a red belt, and that made me want to belong to this profession.",,,,,Q: Tell me a little bit about your family.,"FK: I’m from a polygamous family—my mother, with two other mates. To my father, I’m the eldest of five. Then, from the other mothers, they have five—six and two. So with that, being the eldest, I always try to be a model to the rest of the younger ones. I’m trying to bring them up, as well.",,,,,,Q: When did you hear first about Ebola?,"FK: In 2014, I was at Connaught—during the peak of Ebola, around about August. By then, every morning, you woke up, you think of going to the hospital. The doom when you reached Connaught—people were dying. Each and every one is afraid of touching each other. That psychological effect, even on caregivers—I knew by then—I, as an assistant matron, when we are working, trying to convince the nurses, trying to talk to them, undergoing trainings—because by then, IPC [infection prevention and control] was not that effective. So having to undergo trainings, coping with the work, was really not easy.",,,"Q: Tell me more, a bit more, about that—coping with the care of the patients. What resources did you have?","FK: Space was a big problem, considering the bed capacity at Connaught. Then the wards, we had isolation wards. The rate at which these Ebola cases were being brought into the hospital was alarming. The outpatient department was emptied. All other patients were transferred to the wards and it was closed and made temporarily for receiving Ebola patients. Getting people—the hygienists, the porters—to comply, in terms of patient private property when these patients are being brought in, was a challenge. Because they never knew the reality of it. Some will say, “I’ll just put it into the Klo [bathroom].” We had to be teaching them, as well. ","Then, in terms of the relatives, again, when the patients are being brought, to get them set, settled down, was another problem. The use of the PPEs [personal protective equipment] after the training helped greatly. We had nurses now volunteering to go in—because it wasn’t easy even to get people to walk into the center, until the introduction of the incentive. Then people started opting to go in.",,,,,,"Q: What motivated you to continue? You are telling me that others were so scared about being close to the patients, and—","FK: Well, as a country—as a patriot—we had to save people’s lives. We had to guide people. After undergoing the training you knew what to do—and I think I was ready to go serve. So I went, being the head of the team. At the Aspen center, we worked alongside other foreigners who were doctors, various disciplines in health. ",,,,"Q: How did it feel to work among the different experts, the doctors, and you as a woman? Was it comfortable? How did you manage with that?","FK: Well, I was comfortable—at least having even the chance to work with other nationals. They copied from us; we copied from them, as well. It was so educational. Some of the skills we copied, we adapted. When I became matron, I started introducing them, too, at the hospital where I work—the use of the whiteboard for allocation. ",,,,,,Q: Can you explain a bit more about the outcomes of the patients?,"FK: There was a time I even asked, I said, “Even with this care and honor, that these people keep on dying, then what is the essence for this thing?” The containment merely was to prevent the further infection of the general populace. Throughout, none of the workers, both the hygienists and the medical team and the nursing team—none got infected. We worked successfully.",,,"Q: What stood out in terms of your contact with the families? How did you manage to break the news, to inform them, to interact with them about this disease?","FK: It wasn’t easy—that aspect. Because no sooner a patient has been admitted, we hardly have contact with the relations out there. You come to work—maybe at the registration department, there was some form of communication with the relatives, but hardly, because the sooner you come to work, you are busy getting set to go in, because we go in by schedule. Then, if you are to go in to go feed them, change them, another set will be sent to go in, to go feed them when food is available. ","And in terms of food, also, there was something I observed. For the workers and the patients—the same food was being prepared. Hopeless patients by then—how can they eat big, fat chicken legs, these other sorts of food for people who aren’t sick? I raised a concern to the manager: Why not prepare plain soup, a liquid diet for these people? Because even the sight—when they see it, they feel tormented—not talking of the smell. So they started sending me to do this in the kitchen. I engaged them, told them it would be better to prepare separate food for these people, because all this that you are preparing is wasted. They don’t eat it. When we go later for cleaning, you take the bulk of the foils to the bins, so it’s a waste.",,Q: Because of loss of appetite?,"FK: Yes, they cannot eat. So the cooks started preparing plain soup instead of the normal food they were preparing. And when we went in with it, the patients—some of them--could take two, three spoons.",,,,,"Q: What can you tell the world—what you’ve learned, both, working on Ebola—and things that you will never forget?","FK: Well, the experiences are many—especially, as I said earlier, the coordinated services, the proper communication, the pre-preparedness, even before you go into the unit. When, thirty minutes towards drug administration, you go sit with your partner, you go through the charts, you collect the medication, you plastic them, patient by patient, because when you go in you won’t write, you won’t do anything. Everything is labeled on the plastic tag for the patient, what the patient is to take, so it’s just for you to take the plastic, then you hand over to the patient to see that—you encourage the patient to take it. Even on night duty, there’s not as much that seniority as we have among our own culture, in our settings. Because you had a boss, you won’t do this, you won’t do that. No. We all go in together with the doctors, those that are nurses. We work. You won’t know who’s a doctor, who’s a nurse. That cooperative effort was there, and it worked effectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He knew my passion for caring for him, for sick people in general. “You can make a good nurse,” he said. “Would you like to be a nurse?” I said, “I will think about it.” I grew up with that in my mind, so, when I left school and they asked me about my career interests, I said nursing. I went straight into nursing. So, nursing has been me.",,,,,,"Q: So, how did you first learn about Ebola? What was your first memory of Ebola coming to Sierra Leone?","HC: My first memory of Ebola was sometime in May 2014. I think we had the first Ebola victim on the 24th. She had gone to visit a relative in neighboring Guinea and contracted the disease not knowing. About two months later, we had the case in Freetown. At the recognition of the first case, the Chief Nursing Officer called us to a meeting and said, “if the Ebola is not caught, we have to do something.” They organized training for senior nurses. We were trained how to put on PPEs [Personal Protective Equipment]. The training cascaded to the provincial headquarters, and then to other communities. By then, Ebola was not yet all over the place, but it was gradually moving. It’s very interesting how people contract Ebola. ",,,Q: Can you tell me about it? How do you contract Ebola?,"HC: Well,  when you have Ebola you have to be careful [laughs]—it’s a non-touch technique—it’s a non-touch disease; you shouldn’t touch. You should make sure you’re well-protected if you have to touch. Hands are one of the most infected parts of our body,  so we have to wash our hands frequently. The practice of washing hands was instituted in every hospital, in our homes, in our offices, even in the shops, all over our country. ",,,,,,,Q: Can you talk about what the treatment is? What happened with the nurses? ,"HC: They gave them some immunoboost, Kephazon, and a lot of water. You have to drink a lot and eat—most of the time they don’t eat. Either their heart’s broken, or it’s just that there’s no appetite. ","There was a time where a lot of nurses were infected from maternity units, one after the other. I went there and sent some packets of water and juices, biscuits—you know just to let them feel at least the seniors are not neglecting them. I went there, but I didn’t go into the unit. ",,,"Q: The level of fear, panic, or despair must have been huge in the community. Can you talk about what that was like, your being in a very high-level position?","HC: I live in a community where we have less-privileged people. But they’re the ones when you give them advice, some will adhere to the advice. What wasn’t easy was for them to stop visitation to the sick, because everybody was advised not to visit the sick, and in the African setting it’s not easy to tell somebody not to visit a sick relative. So, some of them went to visit—and they attended funerals, despite the recommendation not to attend, especially if the person died of Ebola. When you attend funerals, and there are many, you might infect yourself. And we stopped shaking hands. We have a culture of shaking of hands in Africa—we like to shake hands. So, we [laughs] stopped the culture [laughs]—everybody kept their hands behind their back.",,,,,,Q: You have been in a position of nursing leadership. Are there other recommendations or things you would want to do? Was your voice heard as a nurse? What would you do if you could plan the new system to have everyone prepared?,"HC: Everybody should have training for Ebola—every nurse, especially nurses—should have training for Ebola. And we can even extend Ebola [training] to the public. Because, when we had the Ebola period, people—even the cooks, the gardeners—they were all trained. So, it’s a matter of community—or let me say, national sensitization. Everybody should be well-equipped now—not with the logistics, but with the knowledge. So, as soon as it happens, if it should happen, we know we’ve got the skills. [They’d] probably forget, but it’s easy to orient. It’s easy to orient when we have the knowledge.",,,"Q: Is there anything else you want to share looking back at this, or going forward?","HC: Anything more? We started a midwifery school in 2013 training male midwives, as well. We had one male midwife, the first male midwife trained in Sierra Leone. But he died during the Ebola scourge. We had another one, a Registered Nurse, who’s doing his B.S. in Nursing. He lost his mother, he lost his wife, he lost his wife’s sister, he lost his mother-in-law, and he lost two children. I was coordinating with him, I said, “I was calling, how are you feeling, are you—?” And then he started having fever. He did not want to go to the treatment center. But after he confided in me, I said, “You know, I’m going to call the treatment center.” Thank God he was saved. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n07,Jestina T. Clarke,Jestina,T.,Clarke,Jennifer Dohrn,15-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,"Midwife, Redemption Hospital","Jestina T. Clarke is a nurse midwife in Monrovia, Liberia. Clarke works at Redemption Hospital and served there during the Ebola epidemic.",Q: How did you decide to become a midwife?,"JTC: When I was coming up as a child, sometimes my mother would take me to the hospital. I used to admire nurses in general. But as I grew up, I developed a love to help in the process, to help pregnant women give birth to children. It was a passion, and I still have that passion. I want to be amongst the people that help to give birth to somebody, to help somebody who is in a dying need. I really love being a midwife. I love to see, to tell a woman: take your time, push, the baby is coming, it’s going to be okay.",,,,,Q: Were there any women in your family who were midwives way back?,"JTC: No, actually I came from a poor family, there was no midwife, there was no doctor. I can say I’m the first to become a health practitioner. ",,,,,,"Q: Can you tell me when you ever heard about Ebola? The word even, or Ebola Viral Disease? And can you describe when you heard about it? What was the circumstance that you first remember?","JTC: In 2014. It was terrible to the ears. Because Ebola was being talked about in the rural county: to be specific, in Lofa. And we used to see the people dressed in the PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] on the television. And it was this rumor that if you come in contact with a person you will die; when they touch you, you will die. So, it was too strong, you know, to accept: looking at us, as Africans, we always interact with each other. But as time went on, we saw the actual picture. ","And to tell you a short story, I lost my husband 2014, June 16, and he was buried June 28. Right after that, we found Ebola was already in the city. And after coming from that stress of the death of my husband, in August, in September I had to go to work. It wasn’t easy. I was afraid because my children were left with only a single parent. If I had gotten infected in the process, it would leave my children behind. ",,"Q: How do you as a midwife, and the midwives, nurses, heal from this trauma of working on such a frontline situation? ","JTC: You know, God has His own way of healing peoples’ minds. As time went on, I saw that cases were being reduced, things were returning to normal. When we left Island Clinic, I was assigned to the transfer unit. We couldn’t even communicate. They were very, very rigid, not allowing us to share anything in common. But we are Liberians. So as time went on we came back to doing our normal work. ","You know that sometimes, when the mother is full, and the baby is trying to come, the woman expels the baby at the entrance of the hospital. Now the woman enters the labor room. You wouldn’t want the baby to fall, so you grab the baby with one hand, and ask for a glove or what have you, you go use disinfectant. But God has been good to our area. ",,,,,,"Q: What are the lessons learned from you as a midwife, and your colleagues, that you would want others to know, or you want in preparation so we can be better responders? What are the things that you saw that you thought were good, what would you do differently?","JTC: First, I would want to say thank you to the international community that actually came to our aid. Because it wouldn’t have been possible for us to fight against Ebola alone; we never had the materials to work with. So, it is always good, like the saying goes, prepare for peace in time of war. And these epidemic diseases can occur anytime, especially when from the onset we bury people, the virus does not die. We need to prepare ahead of time. ",,,,Q: Are there things where you work now that keep nurses and midwives prepared?,"JTC: We are not really prepared. In the absence of Ebola, medical supplies are not just available. Generally, all the hospitals in Liberia, especially the government facilities, we are out of almost everything. For the past six months, I have been in the delivery room. We have people come [unclear], eclamptic patients, and they’re coming to WHO, anybody who is an eclamptic patient within twenty-four hours you need to deliver the baby by caesarean section to save both the mother and the baby. But we do not have material to work with. Even a spinal injection is not available. I’m telling you reality. I’m not saying it because I want people to come and help, but it’s the reality that I am seeing. We are out of almost everything. ",,,,,,"Q: So, be prepared, right? That’s your saying. Do you feel like there have been ways to recognize the contributions of nurses and midwives around Ebola? Have there been things here in Liberia, or in the region, to recognize what nurses and midwives did during the epidemic?","JTC: I don’t know about other countries, but Liberia is a country where the people who do the actual work are not recognized. We work, we put our lives on the line, [and] some nurses died in the process. At the time, people came on the air and said it was due to the negligence of nurses that killed them. ",,,Q: One last question. Are there connections between your being a woman and your being a midwife? ,"JTC: Well, you know, I grew up as a girl before becoming a woman, before even becoming a midwife. For me, I feel for women, especially women who lost their lives in giving birth to children. And African women believe in having children, even when they have many children they still want more. Especially women who are not educated. Midwives are the least considered people in a medical setting in Liberia. We are always overlooked. But for me it’s my passion. It doesn’t matter. ",,,Q: Is your experience being a midwife that doctors listen and respect your views? ,"JTC: Generally the doctors that I’ve been working with, they listen to us. Because mainly, the midwife should know what she’s doing. When we say the woman cannot pass the baby, they will listen.",,,,,Q: And was that somewhat similar during Ebola? That people worked as a team?,"JTC: Yes. People worked as a team. Doctors, nurses, PAs, nurse’s aides, everybody was a team.      ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n08,Dr. Joan Shepherd,Joan,,Shepherd,Susan Michaels-Strasser,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"Principal, Sierra Leone National School of Midwifery","Dr. Joan Shepherd is a nurse midwife in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Dr. Shepherd is the Principal of the National School of Midwifery and the President of the Sierra Leone Midwives Association. Dr. Shepherd worked closely with the Ministry of Health and WHO to develop protocols for childbirth during quarantines and lockdowns. She was instrumental in providing protective equipment and training to nurses and midwives during the Ebola epidemic.","Q: You were the principal of the National School of Midwifery in 2014, when did ",you first hear that there was Ebola in the country? ,"JS: We heard about Ebola in May. But we had started hearing about Ebola in other countries like Congo and then gradually in Guinea and then Zaire, and Liberia, of course.",,,,Q: What role you did you play when you realized Ebola was in the country?,"JS: Everybody was worried, but we were kind of taking things a bit lightly even though it was kind of scary. There were meetings organized by WHO and the ministry, but after a while we realized that Kenema started bearing the brunt of the disease, where we had colleagues, and we started hearing of people dying. It became very chaotic, and everybody was afraid. Everybody was worried about what would happen next. We were all obsessed with news about Ebola and what to do, how do we protect the students? We instituted hand washing measures. We also did awareness and sensitization, told the students to avoid touching, to be careful not to treat people at home, you know, even neighbors. ",,,,,,"Q: And during that year and you were working with the students, and you started putting in measures to protect the students, did your role change over time, or did you remain the principal and that was your primary focus throughout 2014?","JS: No, my role changed. I was still the principal, but then all of a sudden when it comes to midwifery, and the maternity setting we had the announcement of a three day lockdown. The government and the ministry of health had teams of young people going house to house giving them hand soap to wash their hands, pamphlets, literature teaching people how to tackle Ebola. ","I was invited to a meeting with the program manager of malaria control. I was there as a stakeholder in midwifery services. We started looking at different zones, who should be a supervisor, who should be manager, and to divide them, the different people, into different zones. I raised up a concern: “So three days lockdown. What would happen to women if they go into labor?” And I remember a colleague saying to me that we are not here to talk about labor. We’re not talking about women. Ebola is something that is very scary, so we would not be looking at that. And I said, but what if in the event, while the three-day lockdown, a woman goes into labor? And everybody sort of dismissed me. I didn’t push too much, but I left the meeting a bit worried.",,Q: So what happened during those three days?,"JS: The ministry put my phone number on a radio program. We started receiving calls from pregnant women to see maybe someone will say there is a woman in labor. We did a quick sort of training to say now we are going out to collect women who are in labor and maintain all infection prevention control measures. We had a thermometer, gloves, and delivery kits. The ambulance driver would lead us. But then some of the midwives would be in one vehicle, and then we also had another vehicle. ","On one call for delivery the lady was a teenager in prima gravida. Her vaginal passage was very tight. There was no way she could push the baby out. I realize that, uh-uh, I will have to do an episiotomy. It was a very dark room. The nurses held onto the lamp and then I was able to see. I gave a quick cut, and the baby came out, and we were able to resuscitate the baby. Then we gave the woman antibiotic pain killer and taught her breastfeeding. ","We had calls for about six women who were in labor. I started to realize that in a day’s time we might have maybe ten or twelve women in labor.  You know, I said that I thought maybe one, two three, but not as much as twelve. So we went around. Sometimes we had trouble locating their houses, but the ambulance driver was able to. It was a bit scary, like going to the unknown. The relatives are there. If a woman has a fever we do not deny her services. We just make sure that we take proper protection. Some of the women were not yet ready to deliver the baby. So we took them to the hospital, where they were triaged and screened. ","We had to have meetings to teach people, to create awareness and sensitization. And then the other risk is that having have been out there for this you are thinking, okay, I’ve played my role. I’ve sensitized people how to protect themselves, but then you realize you are also putting yourself at risk. I worried that after all that when I went back home to the family. During those periods with my kids, no hugging or handshaking. It’s more hand washing. We instituted hand washing measures at home and also in the community where I live.  In the hospital setting we had some midwives who were afraid to come to work. But the team that we were working with was more confident.","It was very traumatic period for us that we were living each day. Each day we lived on hope to be safe. And sometimes I would say to myself I haven’t touched anyone but what if I have sat on a surface that somebody has sat on? I said, no, I didn’t go to the hospital. I only went to the school. But then there are times when we thought the nurses are out. They are giving their best, so we need to be there to support them. I would say no, no, I think I need to be in the hospital. I made sure I put on a special shoe, and that shoe doesn’t go into the house unless I’ve washed it with chlorine. I would go to the maternity ward to check on the midwives, see how they were",,,"Q: Well, this is an amazing story of your journey, and I just keep thinking how strong you were, how resilient, what kept you going? And from the beginning you said, well, what about the women who go into labor during the lock down? What do you think was driving you and that continued to drive you?","JS: So those of us who were leaders in the nursing field thought that if we break down this is going to be disastrous. We thought we couldn’t allow this to happen. There was a saying that when you have war it’s the military, and when you have disease outbreak it’s the nurses. ","So we say that we are now the soldiers. I am a nurse, and this is the only way. I’m not necessarily putting myself at risk since I am more knowledgeable about how to protect myself. But what about the drivers who don’t know much about IPC? They’re also out there giving their best. And it gives you hope to say that if I go out there to reach out to others, to create awareness; if I sensitize them, then I will be able to save more lives. And then you get this inner—I mean, when you realize that the next day, oh, I’m alive, then you get this push to say then I need to be out there to assist. And the next day when you keep on doing the same thing. At first it’s scary to start, but the hope is that I’m doing all that I’m supposed to do. You say, okay, now we have just checked the temperature. She’s fine. I have my gloves. I have my decontaminant. I avoid unnecessary vaginal examination. I avoid unnecessary exposure of fluids. ",,,"Q: During that time you talked about how you educated your children to prevent infection, and you talked about not being able to hug your children. How long was it that you didn’t hug your children?","JS: It was months. I was not able to count because it’s strange. It’s like you are even afraid of your student, your children, and your children are afraid. I couldn’t even count. I was just praying for the day that they would say this is the last case. All we were waiting for was that they should say that we are freed of Ebola. I couldn’t count days. I couldn’t count months. I was so involved in terms of saying that all of us should stay alive that I was not even counting. For me, hugging and handing of things, you know, without washing the hands was, it’s a moment we have to survive. It was a moment of living. We lived through each day, each week, each month, not counting. I never had time to sit down and count. Mentally I was engaged, and I was like a mother hen trying to see that how to protect the family. And being on the frontline, my thinking was that I should not be the one who should bring an infection into the house. So when I’m out there, I make sure that I adhere to the universal precautional measures.","So being a mom, they understood. We used to tease each other, I mean to make light of the situation. When I came home my boys would ask me have you washed your hands? And I said, ah, now it’s the opposite. Instead of me asking you whether you’ve washed your hands, and then when I’m going out they say, “Mommy, be careful. Don’t touch people. We know you. You want to go.” But I think we used the moment—we didn’t touch, but we used the moment to sit as a family, and we would watch the TV. It gave us time to even reflect now, ooh. ",,,,,"Q: How do you feel we can best address complacency, and you know what to do if by definition universal precautions, you’ve said that this transcends everything? If we do that we’re saving people. How do you feel we can best combat complacency?          ","JS: I think, one, we have to strengthen existing structures. Presently the Ministry of Health has put in place IPC focal persons, and I think IPC should be inbuilt, inbuilt. I think that it should become—IPC should be everybody’s responsibility. In terms of complacency I think we should have in place disciplinary measures, you know. And we should have in place refreshers. It should be inbuilt that anybody, any new worker, any new person that’s coming in, because you have nurses who are just beginners. I think we should have refresher training. We should have orientation where workers are inducted. We should also have infrastructural support. Compliance also has to do also with leadership issues. You have to have a leader who believes in IPC, a leader who promotes that at various levels. If you go to the laboratory, you go to the theater, IPC should be embedded in all of our activities, even the gate man, even from the gate, the gate man, the porter, everybody who’s a healthcare worker. ","I think people should be audited sometimes -- I don’t like to use the word audited, but I think people should be called to book. We should have committees where if something goes wrong there should be a committee where we could look at what went wrong. We need to support people out there, constant support. The reason why the complacency is also creeping in is that the structures do not hold over time. It has to be permanent. It has to be integrated at part of the services that we offer. IPC should not be just a unit. IPC should be all over, wherever you go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n09,Josephine Finda Sellu,Josephine,Finda,Sellu,Jennifer Dohrn,13-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"Public Health Nurse, Sierra Leone Psychiatric Hospital","Josephine Finda Sellu is a public health nurse currently working at the Sierra Leone Psychiatric Hospital having graduated with a masters in public health. During the Ebola epidemic, Sellu was a deputy nurse matron at Kenema Government Hospital. In August 2014, her image was featured on the front page of the New York Times, illustrating the sacrifices of nurses and other healthcare workers. At that point, Sellu had lost fifteen of her colleagues to the outbreak.",Q: Can you tell me about your particular role in how you looked at the training of nurses?,"JFS: When the numbers of infected cases started increasing, Dr. Khan, together with Tulane University and Metabiota, brought training to Kenema Government Hospital for all medical superintendents and matrons all over the country. We did the training for two days. But my boss, she was a bit older than me, the senior head nurse in charge, said, “No, no, Dr. Khan, I am a bit older, Josephine is a bit younger than me. Let her go and do the training.” That’s how she pushed me into it now, but because it’s my job, I am a nurse, and this is a new disease that has shown face in Sierra Leone, the curiosity made me want to know more. I decided to go for the training. ",,,,,Q: What about the other nurses?,"JFS: Yes, volunteer nurses came onboard. I had twenty-one of them initially. I still have their names in my computer, the twenty-one nurses who volunteered, and they were not on salary. ",,,,,,Q: Volunteer nurses. You volunteered. You got other nurses to volunteer to do this.,"JFS: Well, I was on salary, but the government was not paying us extra for what we were doing. Well, the same volunteers, some of them became infected, and started dying like this, [snaps] dying, dying, dying. Before we could say one week, two weeks, three weeks, one month, we’ve lost about eight of them.",,,Q: Eight of them.,"JFS: And so it was scary. And my own people started calling me from Freetown. Leave that environment. Leave the environment. Nurses have started dying. What are you doing there? Leave this environment. And once I did, I switched my number so that l would not receive calls from anybody, because the passion—when you go to the units, before you enter the units, you hear patients crying, “Nurse, nurse, water, water, water,” calling for water, and so that sound was the one that really moved me. I said, if we don’t go and give them water, who will go and give them water? So I started wearing PPE. I said come, let’s wear PPE, and that was the time now I started wearing PPE. Take the nurses together. We go in. We give them water. We mix ORS [oral rehydration salts] in containers, put them in the ward, encourage them to drink. You meet people dying, more than fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. Sometimes I don’t like to recall. It was terrible by day, you know?","WHO was on the ground, but they were not really active. They would just come take photos, go for EOC [environment of care] meetings. That was the time I refused to go to an EOC meeting. I said I will not go to an EOC meeting to explain how many people have died. Other people are still suffering over there. ","It was like that, until when Dr. Khan now became infected, and he came to the hospital in the morning and said, “Josephine, I’m not well. I’m not well. I’m not feeling myself. So please make sure you take care of those that are here for now, the patients that are in the ward.” And then he called one of our nurses, Tamba, asking to have treatment at home. Tamba took some drugs, malaria treatment, and went to give him treatment. But the day after they collected the sample, immediately somebody called me from the lab to say, “Oh, my sister, Dr. Khan has been proven positive.” I said, “What? Dr. Khan positive?” She said, “Yes, but we have decided to take him to Kailahun.” I said, “Why to Kailahun? Can’t we manage him here?” They said, “No. The entire team—Metabiota, Tulane University—they have decided—” By then, MSF [Médecins Sans Frontières] had established their own Ebola center in Kailahun district, and we were in Kenema. ","They took Dr. Khan to Kailahun. They took him on Wednesday evening. In the morning hours, we sent some nurses there with jelly, coconut jelly. You know jelly? Coconuts, the younger coconut, you know, it has a lot of fruit inside. We call it jelly, it was a supplement we used to give. You know, we just used to give an antibiotic, but for Dr. Kahn we added fluid. We opened two IV lines, set up a drip, and gave the coconut jelly water. The three first survivors from our unit survived with the jelly water, and so it was now part of what we do. We brought some of this jelly and then had two nurses bring the jelly water for Dr. Khan in Kailahun. That was a Thursday. Friday, I went there to see him. ","I went to the unit, the MSF Ebola treatment center. I went there, and they made provision for me to go to the visitors’ area. He was sitting in a rubber chair, and the IV fluid was hung on him. The drip was turning. Immediately, he saw me, he started crying. He started crying, and tears were coming from his eyes. And I said, “Doctor, it’s okay. Dr. Khan, it is well. Don’t cry, doctor. Don’t cry.” And I also started crying. Then the white lady that was there, MSF, the white doctor said, “No, don’t cry. If he’s crying, you are crying, so it’s okay, now you’ve said greetings, you can go now.” And so I left. I left on Friday. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and then he passed away. ","[pause] After his death , it was so hard—this was somebody that had been giving us courage, somebody that had been talking to us, you know? And then he lost his life. I am just a nurse. If that man has died with all the expertise in community, hospital protocol, hemorrhagic fevers, he’s the only expert, and now he’s dead. ","I said, I’m going to leave this job. I’m going home. I will no longer work here. I’m going home. I went home crying. I cried for the rest of the day. Then, at night again they called me. “Matron, Matron, Nurse So-so is dead.” “I know that nurse. I know that nurse,” I said. “What can I do?” You know? And I said I will not go there, but when they called me, I went there again. I went there.","Q: How did you think about explaining this to the community? Were nurses active in teaching the community about what Ebola was, or how to prevent it, or come in for treatment?","JFS: When the thing started creating serious alarm, I was mainly in the management treatment center, and the social mobilization team, those are the nurses and other health workers, CHOs [community health officers], they used to go out and do sensitization. But the community people were not convinced about Ebola, initially. In fact, one time a mad woman came to the marketplace and started shouting, “There’s no Ebola! There’s no Ebola! These nurses and health workers are liars! I am a nurse!” And she started saying that she’s a nurse. “It’s just cannibalism. I am a nurse. I am a nurse. There is no Ebola. It is just cannibalism they want to do. It is just cannibalism they want to do.” And the whole market went into chaos, and they say, “Oh, you are talking it. We are saying it, that there is no Ebola. A nurse is confessing! Witchcraft! Witchcraft!” ","And so the whole village converged to go and burn the hospital, the Kenema Government Hospital. When they came there, we are storming off, we are hiding, finding place to hide ourselves. They said they want to burn down the hospital. They want to kill every nurse—they were saying, “You kill one nurse, we give you one thousand. You kill one—” If anybody kills one nurse, they will give that person one thousand, because we are lying that Ebola is real, and Ebola—somebody has confessed from our group that there is no Ebola. The police, the military now came and dispersed them. They used teargas. It was terrifying.",,,Q: So what would you do differently? What would you want to do if you were given the power to make new policy? What would you want nurses to do?,JFS: I would start with the policymakers and their failure to recognize what the nurses have done.,"If those that are up there can really do some form of capacity-building for our nurses. It’s only now that nurses have started getting masters, first degree. Initially in Sierra Leone it was just nursing assistants, community health nurses, RN [registered nurse], and that’s the end. And that’s the end. Midwifery -- not everyone will go for midwifery -- and that’s the end. But if you have that capacity, if they can try to build up a new curriculum, improving the nursing standard, you understand, that will help us. ","Because of my training I knew what hemorrhagic fevers meant. That’s why I took my own money to make a scrub for myself, to buy boots for myself, to cut my hair, because my hair was long, in dreads. I don’t want to infect myself going into the Ebola units. Sometimes I was in an Ebola treatment center for one hour, and I didn’t know what I would contact, so I decided, let me cut my hair. I called the barber and my hair was cut. I did it because the knowledge is there, that’s why. That’s wanted. If we can improve, build on our capacity, nurses in this country, that’s when we can help for any subsequent outbreak.","And for we nurses, we should not just say, “I’ve done my certificate. I think I’m okay.” If you have the will, you say, “No, I’m going to improve myself.” I started nursing as a nursing aide, nursing assistant, and I’ve gone to this level now with a Master’s in Public Health, because I have the determination. I want to go forward. I want to learn more. I want to know more. I want to know, you know? So for the nurses, now, let them also have that initiative and say now, “Let me try to develop myself.” ","The other thing is for policy makers. Let’s say somebody has done something good, to see just a tap on your back. Like me, with all what I went through, nobody recognized me in Sierra Leone. The government didn’t recognize me. My senior authorities, nobody recognized me. Instead, the boss—and I’m going to say it, and it’s on tape, and I am saying it. I told Dr. Shephard, “With all what I did, sacrificing myself and my family, after that, the then-outgoing Chief Nursing Officer, instead of giving me a tap on my back to say, ‘Josephine, thank you for what you have done,’ she took me from where I was and sent me to the most remote area Kailahun District. I had to walk on foot. I had to bike to go to where I am supposed to work. ","Instead of her just saying, “Okay, you’ve done more than what we are expecting, now you can go to Freetown, now you can go to a better facility,” she took me to the most remote facility. And I suffered there a lot.” [crying] Our elders, those ahead of us, they should recognize us. As nurses, we are doing a great job, but we are not recognized. We are not recognized. We are not recognized. We are not recognized. Not a single recognition was given to me. It was only when The New York Times came and did a story with me, and then I had also some few guys came from Diaspora Focus [phonetic]—I came with this purposely to show you.

n10,Margaret Loma Phiri,Margaret,Loma,Phiri,Jennifer Dohrn,14-Aug-19,Freetown,Malawi,"Former Regional Advisor for Nursing and Midwifery, WHO AFRO","Margaret Loma Phiri is a nurse midwife from Malawi. Phiri is currently a nursing advisor for Seed Global Health. Previously, Phiri worked as a regional advisor for nursing and midwifery at WHO AFRO. In 2015, Phiri went to Sierra Leone on behalf of the WHO to work on strengthening maternal and newborn health in that country during the Ebola epidemic. Phiri is a nurse educator with a masters in education and taught for many years at the Blantyre School of Nursing at the University of Malawi. As part of Columbia University's On the Frontlines project, Phiri conducted interviews with Ebola nurses in Sierra Leone and Liberia in August 2019.",Q: Can I ask you: when was the first time you heard of Ebola?,"MLP: The first time I really heard of Ebola was the time when there was Ebola in Sierra Leone. I had never heard about it before. And as a matter of fact, when I was asked to go to Sierra Leone I was a bit scared, because I really didn’t know what it was all about, and the risks that one would take, that I was taking, to come into the country which had just gone through and was still going through that epidemic.",,,,,"Q: Later, when you returned to Sierra Leone after your holiday trip to Malawi, were there nurses who had died from Ebola that you had known?","MLP: Most of them I didn’t know then, but one thing I learned was that actually most of them who died were really the frontline nurses, the second level, the enrolled nurses who really do provide bedside care. Those were the ones that died, in majority, and, of course, some of the doctors, too. And we had the opportunity to visit the hospital where the Ebola started, in Kenema, where they have a statue for all those who died, so you can read their names. They are there.",,,,,,Q: Who did the statue? Who put up the statue?,"MLP: I think it was put up by the government itself, Ministry of Health. ",,,Q: There were that many nurses that had died.,"MLP: Yes, the number was about 222, although some think that maybe some were not recorded. And most of those were recorded were the ones maybe who were officially employees of the Ministry. Very sad story. Sad. Sad in the sense that nursing lies in caring for people, and if you can’t care you’re not doing anything. And then if in the process of caring you become a victim yourself, then it’s really a different, tragic story. And it was, I think, because of that that one of the priorities during the—when the epidemic had just started, and even in the course of recovery, was how can we make sure that people, especially providers themselves, are protected. How do we do that? And that was one of the key interventions in the process of managing the Ebola itself.",,,,,,,"Q: So then with Ebola, the outbreak and the rapid spread around, what was your sense of how communities saw nurses during Ebola time?","MLP: Communities saw nurses, on average, as their sources of hope, in the sense that you see you have this group, which you will call state-enrolled community health nurses, and that group works right in the communities, so they are really part of the entry point into the normal or formal healthcare system. And that’s why most of them, it’s that category that died, because of their closeness, one, to the communities, and also really working as formal frontline health workers. I think the nurses did a great job in terms of providing the care and the information, the health education, community awareness-raising about the disease, as the group that is closest to them.","In addition to that, in Sierra Leone, nurses form more than seventy percent of the healthcare workers. They’re the majority, so every program you go through, they’re the people that are literally manning the interventions. What I’m trying to say here is that the community relied on the support from this group, right at an entry level point in terms of if they were sick or whatever, those were the people that actually provided the first line of care.",,,"Q: In looking at what were the lessons learned and where to go forward, maybe you could talk about that a little more from the perspective of nursing. What were missed opportunities to not have nurses at leadership, or were there—in structuring a response and then going forward? What do you think, looking back at this? You said some things you think were really important changes.","MLP: Having appropriate knowledge and skills is key. So is putting in place communication systems for proper coordination. Thirdly, availability of the required resources: drugs, utensils, PPEs -- appropriate ones, not ad hoc. And fourthly, really giving recognition to people when they’re doing such a great job, because it was a risk, a real risk for those who helped and still survived. I think they need to be thanked or recognized professionally, to say, “You made a difference in the lives of people.” The last is to promote working as a team, because no single professional group can solve all the problems, and I think the nurses dutifully recognized that. They didn’t think to say because we’re in charge then we can work just on our own. No, they did everything involving the communities, the patients themselves, telling a story to say, “You know what? We feel bad about the patients themselves, because of the restrictions of infection prevention.” These people still needed to be seen by their relatives, just to say hello. And they devised means on how they can still communicate, and allow them even to pray, which I thought was, wow, yes. Those were some of the things that give hope to patients, yes, that they still felt, oh, not all is lost. So putting in some of these human touches, things that may not be prescribed in the book, but that show, as people, what do you stand for?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n11,Marthalyne G.N. Freeman,Marthalyne,GN,Freeman,Jennifer Dohrn,15-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,"Deputy Nursing Director, ELWA Hospital","Marthalyne Freeman is a nurse at ELWA hospital in Monrovia, Liberia. Freeman was first certified as a trained traditional midwife before returning to school to become a registered nurse. Freeman, who is also a pastor, worked in the Ebola Treatment Unit as a counselor for patients.",Q: When did you first actually become involved with someone who had Ebola? Do you remember?,"MGNF: I was among the nurses, the first group of nurses to care for the first people, the patient that came out of the ELWA Hospital. We received the first patient. ELWA Hospital was the only hospital in Mesurado [Montserrado] that was prepared to receive Ebola patients. We were trained: nurses were trained, the hygienists were trained. We were prepared medically to receive our Ebola patients, and we did receive the first Ebola patient.",,,,,Q: So what did you learn in the training? What does it mean to be trained?,"MGNF: For the first time we were asked to be trained, people said, “No, I’m not going to be trained, I’m not going to be a part, because that’s dangerous. That disease kills. I’m not going to be a part. I’m going to go and sit home, so I don’t need to be trained.” So there were people who were leaving the facility, and some never wanted to be trained. But we stood up, management stood and said, “Everyone must be trained, because this is not an individual business; it’s nationwide. So you must be trained. If you are not trained, you will be sacked.” So people came down. And in the training we learned how to receive, how to dress. They call it donning, where you are dressing.","I was on the team that counseled the relatives of victims. And then, unfortunately my daughter was also victimized for Ebola. She is married and has two children, twins. Her husband’s family, the entire family, all seventeen persons, came down with Ebola. Nine survived. I think eight died. And my daughter was taken to the Ebola unit that I worked in. ","I received her, and I ushered her in. I received her husband. I ushered him in. I received the mom, the mother-in-law, the sister-in-law, the aunt-in-law, and I put them in. And then she looked at me and said, “Mom, I’m going to die.” I said, “You’re not going to die.” She said, “But you’re not going to leave me here. You’re going to stay with me.” And she held me. And I was crying in the goggles when I was leaving. It was the highest trauma that I ever experienced, not even compared to childbirth, because I saw my daughter and her husband and the family, and then I had the kids to be quarantined. They were just two years old at that time, just one year six months, a boy and a girl. She had twins. It was traumatizing. I worked in the Ebola unit from the beginning of Ebola to the end, when Liberia was announced Ebola-free. I washed my hands, and I said, “Thank God.”","When it comes to nursing, we were traumatized, but no one did anything with the trauma that the nurses faced. That’s why I ask you why are you coming now. Because we were traumatized. You saw people—bodies. You see a nurse. You see a midwife. You see a doctor. And you see your neighbor. You see your daughter. And there after the whole Ebola crisis, no one cared to appreciate the nurses that work in the unit. There isn’t even a list. Where is the list of the nurses that worked in the Ebola unit? You’re supposed to have a document for that, that tomorrow you will tell my grandchildren that your grandmother worked in an Ebola unit to save lives. That’s not so. That’s why—",,,Q: It was never done.,"MGNF: I’m only speaking to you because I fear God. That’s all. Even if you can’t do it, let me be recognized. That’s what they’re supposed to do. People are hurt. People are hurt. People were traumatized. My husband said, “I don’t want you in the house.” I was not in the house. I was put out, because I worked in the Ebola unit. He said I shouldn’t come so I can’t infect him, and I was sleeping in the hospital. I slept in the hospital for a year.",Q: Has there been any work to help nurses absorb this trauma? ,"MGNF: I was prepared before going into the Ebola unit, to care for Ebola patients. I was psychologically prepared, so I wasn’t much traumatized as compared to others. But it was traumatic. You are sweating up. You are soaked with cold, with tears, with sweat, because it is hot in there. And you stay in there for two hours, establishing the IV line, making sure, even performing deliveries. Yes, we performed delivery in the Ebola unit. I did a delivery there. ","I entered the nursing field to have compassion, to have empathy. That’s what kept me there, not because of where I work, how much I make. That’s why. But I thank God. Thanks be to the almighty God who saved me, and saved my daughter and her husband, that I had to go and treat, gave her medication, and she looked in my eyes and said, “Mom, are you leaving me to go out? Are you going to come back? When?” I said, “I’m going to change, and I will come back to you. Please.” And she would run, grab me, and my friends would say, “Please, let her [phonetic] go.” And then, when I came home, I said, “Jesus, I just want her to survive, God. Just do it for me that she survives.” She survived.","You were asking the question what should be done. We need to put people in our shoes. You know what I mean? Let me feel the same way you feel. Let me not see you as a white woman, she came from down here; she’s just a black woman, she’s just nobody. But let me see you, and see Jesus in you. But people are not acting like that. If you know why you became a nurse, nothing will separate you. I’m not afraid of any disease. Even if I died, I die serving God through serving humanity. So I was prepared. I said, if I should die, yes, yeah I die. [laughs] I [would have] died because I’m serving somebody. I’m doing what God has called me to do. So if He wants me to die, well, that’s it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n12,Mary A.M. Fullah,Mary,AM,Fullah,Susan Michaels-Strasser,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer, Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation",Mary Fullah is currently serving as the Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer for the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation. Fullah is a nurse midwife and worked in the reproductive health and family planning program at Princess Christian Maternity Hospital during the Ebola epidemic.,Q: Who trained you?,"MF:  I was trained by WHO. We were the first set of nurses that were trained. Within the first week, we were trained before we were sent out. We started training in Freetown. So we went, and I trained them, crash training within two, three hours telling them what to do, the safe areas, how to handle the cases. We left and went back to look if the sister was getting a little bit better because she was having a drip and so forth. By the time we returned to that center, it was filled up. People were outside vomiting—you name it. We were so overwhelmed, I cried that morning—that afternoon when I stood out in front. It was now the soldiers, because we had some soldiers with us, who closed the doors so that people would stop bringing people because the whole compound was already full.We went to Kono as well, Tonkolili, so we went. We are also doing some radio discussions in the night for people to understand. We went to the schools, we did some crash training again with the tutors who we had there and the students who we had there. So I came back to PCMH [Princess Christian Maternity Hospital]. Again, the Western Area, I was deep in the Western Area, Eastern. We had these people who were in the community that we are notifying, went from house to house.",,,,,"Q:  During the Ebola period, could you paint a picture of how things changed over time, how the nursing changed? ","MF:  When we heard about the Ebola—in fact, we were all scared, everybody. Because it started in Kailahun, the far east, with a case that came in from they said Guinea or so, and the nurse who was there died. So, we had this case, and we were all scared. We started reading about Ebola and so forth. So, what happened, some people really stopped coming to work. It became harder for us to sustain the nursing care to even those who were not Ebola cases. In fact, the nursing care was stopped. Some of us stopped coming to work unless they were very eager, you know? So, what happened when we started with that, the whole place, in fact some hospitals, they stopped working. So, there was no policy on Ebola. We never knew anything, no strategy, no nothing. So, for the reproductive health, we closed our office and worked together with WHO to develop a policy for Ebola and a strategy with WHO. So, every day, we spent some time with WHO before we went back to the office. So, we started with that development and then I think when expats came in, that was when they started training us on Ebola how to prevent and so forth. How to treat and so forth.",,,,,,"Q: And from the beginning from the first cases to becoming a stable situation where more health workers came back, how long did that take? How many?","MF:  I think after the first month, because in the first month it was like chaos. After some time, they said the soldiers will be at the at the lead EOC [Emergency Operations Center]. Then we are now monitoring everything throughout the country. The district council chair people made rules and regulations like there was a barricade. If you are coming into this district they have to monitor you, you must answer some questions and so forth. And they have to know where you are going to stay so that they will make a follow-up for the first two, three days. So that was very good. Like for Pujehun district that was when we had only two cases in Pujehun district, you know, as soon as that was set up. And every road, the one from Liberia, the one from Freetown was blocked. They had people sitting there twenty-four hours, ensuring that whoever comes in is checked up. ",,,Q: What kept you going? ,"MF:  We learned that the nurses were looking up to us. If we leave, what happens? So we stayed. We stayed and we looked for opportunities. We went to meetings. And we started this policy book, and putting things together,",,,,,,,Q: Who’s training the doctors now?,"MF:  Everybody. They are training the doctors on surveillance. We have asked them that nurses can also be surveillance officers, and they will be the best surveillance officers. But most of the training is for doctors. ",,,,Q: Because nurses are primarily women? ,"MF:  Yes. And women are considered third class, not even second. [laughs] No. Well women are second class, yes. But they forget that if the nurses don’t work, the doctors will not work. We can do some work that the doctors do, but they will not ever do the nursing. They don’t know how to do it. ","Nurses are found everywhere wherever you go in Sierra Leone. Even if you go to the last village, you find a nurse there. So if you don't train that nurse to pick up things from that area, when will the doctor in Freetown or Bo or Makeni get to it? So if we don’t train the nurses, the diseases will keep coming up. In fact the time they come up they will now take us in the next few years—if we don’t stop doing that and showing that the nurses who are at the far end are aware of these things, and they can recognize it, and they can do something about it, then we’ll be ready for disasters all the time. Where the big doctors will be now to write the books and so forth. But the actual workers are right here in the field who are the nurses. ",,,,,Q: What are those things that rise to the top of your mind that are the most important that World Health Organization needs to know?,"MF: The knowledge of Ebola must be not only for health workers but for everybody. And not only Ebola, but all the hemorrhagic diseases and so forth. Nurses must have not only crash trainings but continued training, because your mind relaxes as time passes by. It can even become a degree, a course that nurses can go and do. The training needs to go on. It should not stop, because as we are seeing in Congo, Ebola comes day and night, in and out. We should be sure that every hospital, even once a year, goes through that Ebola training again. ","We should also not forget about waste disposal. When you go to some facilities, the incinerators, are burnt out or broken, and then these infections can crop up again. We need to ensure the management of waste in the facilities, and even in the communities. Number three is surveillance. We don’t have to sit down to wait for disease to come and greet us. We have to go and look out for them. So to summarize: the trainings have to continue, we have to continue looking at our waste management, and we have to look at surveillance.  They are training doctors, doctors, doctors. Well, who sees the cases first? The nurses. And we should ensure that nurses can now identify infection, they can sort them out and bring them to the doctors. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kogar,Ramatta,Y,Kogar,Annette Mwansa Nkowane,15-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,"Nurse; Chairperson, West African College of Nursing, Liberian Chapter","Ramatta Kogar is a nurse and the chairperson of the West African College of Nursing, Liberian Chapter. Kogar is a graduate of the Mother Patern College of Health Sciences and holds a masters in public health.","Q: So, when did you first hear about Ebola? That Liberia was affected by the Ebola virus disease?","RYK: Fortunately, when I heard about Ebola, I was home one morning. I was listening to the radio, and somebody said there was an Ebola case in Lofa, one of our counties in Liberia here. That was 2014. So, I was like Ebola? Because I actually did not know much. We knew about Ebola, that it was deadly, and XYZ, but in the real in depth, I did not know. I decided to do fuller research, and it became serious. Everybody started talking about Ebola. I found out how Ebola affected Congo. But then people started having myths. ",,,,,Q: What are those myths?,"RYK: People believed that Ebola was not real. That the government wants to get money from the outside world, so they just brought a disease. Some people said it was because of foods like bats or rats. Some people actually believed it was witchcraft. Then it became more serious when there was a family that went to a party and all the food was poisoned. Everyday, one person would get sick, every day the next person would get sick, and people started dying. So, they attributed it to poison. ","From my knowledge as a nurse, I started to tell my staff that we have to be careful. Prior to Ebola, when we are doing your blood pressure, or we’re doing your temperature, we’re doing a lot of touching. When Ebola became present in the country, the belief was still that it was not Ebola. People were poisoned, or they’re witched, and all that. So, I told my staff that we have to start changing our way of practice. We started wearing gloves for everything we do, we started washing our hands more frequently, and we actually minimized the amount of touching we do. If I had to touch a patient, I would make sure I have gloves on.",,,,,"Q: Following on the outbreak of Ebola, what do you think has changed for the Liberian healthcare system? ","RYK: Ebola actually boosted our healthcare system. Before Ebola, as I said, even in my little practice where I worked, we cared, we just did anything. I would easily see somebody’s blood and just use cotton to try to stop it from coming, but not since Ebola. We found that a lot of people - we practice hand washing a lot. Before Ebola, handwashing was something that maybe, if I played with something, and it spilled on my hands, then I know I would have to wash my hands. But Ebola really opened our eyes as health workers, as nurses. A lot of nurses and midwives died. People who had those patients, they died, and it was not easy. When you hear “oh, this person died, oh, this person died from Ebola,” everybody was afraid. ","So, Ebola taught the health system a lesson.",,"Q: In the community, what were some of the beliefs that affected the epidemic? ","RYK: There was a stigma as nurses. Yes, there was stigma. My brother told me not to go to work, even though I was not working in a big hospital. Even though I was only dealing with employees, my husband was afraid of me. When I would come from work because I have my own car to drive, and I would go straight into the bathroom and go and shower before I even go and touch my own children. Before I even go and find food to eat.","It really brought a lot of people down. Some people even had issues in their marriages, or in their relationships. Children and their parents, when your parent, or your child was sick. There was a time when one of my daughters was sick, and they called me and said Jackie vomited and said her head was hurting. The first thing I said was that nobody should touch her. So, when we came back home. We came in the evening, the fever had broken down, and we took her to the hospital, the nursery. It was malaria she had. But everybody was just afraid of everybody during Ebola. ",,,,,,Q: What do you say you are proud of from this whole experience? ,"I’m proud because, where I worked, the education, educational messages that we sent out, I believe that people listened. In the corridors, you would hear, “Ramatta, thank you. What you told me, it saved me today. Somebody was sick, and I was able to do this. What you told me, you see my hand? That is my washing hand, or this small thing I touched, I had to wash my hands.” So, I thought I was doing something little, but that education that I gave to people, it helped them to manage their lives, during Ebola.",,,,Q: Any other lessons you drew from Ebola that you can share?,"RYK: One of the best practices that we have now is that ambulance service. Initially, we never had ambulances. As a result, most of the time, a lot of people died in their homes. When you call somebody and tell them that you have a patient, the first thought that goes through somebody’s mind is maybe they’re Ebola, so I’m not coming there. Because of Ebola, everybody stayed by themselves, and a lot of people died in their homes, because we never had ambulances to take them from their homes. But since Ebola came we have almost all the health facilities have ambulances. Private or government, at least an ambulance is assigned there, and people have a service where you can call and the ambulance will come and take you to the hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the Ebola outbreak, Nkowane served as the Technical Officer of Nursing and Midwifery in the World Health Organization's Health Workforce Department. Previously, she worked with other WHO departments including Mental Health and Substance Dependence and Gender and Women's Health. Nkowane trained as a community health nurse before completing a masters in human resource development. Prior to her position at the WHO, Nkowane worked with International Federation of the Red Cross on developing community-based first aid. As part of Columbia University's On the Frontlines project, Nkowane conducted interviews with Ebola nurses in Sierra Leone and Liberia in August 2019.","Q: Will you tell me your name and what job you’ve held around nursing, your orientation?","AMN: I am Zambian. I’m a nurse, a midwife as well a community health nurse. After I qualified as a registered nurse in Zambia, I worked in Zambia at different levels, at the provincial level, community and district levels. I was involved in communities a lot, working with the traditional birth attendants, community health workers.  Later, I was able to sit for the State Board exams and started working as a registered nurse in the state of Georgia and later in the state of Illinois.","Once I got my degree in Nursing, I joined my husband Dr. Nkowane who had been offered a job in Geneva with the World Health Organization, to start an AIDS program, because in the ’80s, HIV infections were beginning to take hold.",,,,Q: I would like to ask you to tell me when you first heard about Ebola.,"AMN: I can’t remember exactly which year, but when it first happened in Uganda.  By November 2014, it became apparent that this was not going anywhere.  I was attached to the Ebola Technical group.  We mobilized nurses to participate in the Ebola response, because WHO really cannot employ so many people, we rely on our partners.  There were no standards at that time. For example, one cannot just say a nurse should spend five minutes with an Ebola patient. More details are needed to offer the best option such as, where is this patient located? Has he or she just been admitted, or are they under treatment? How long does it take for a nurse to put on the PPE? All those things had to be taken into consideration.  And I think the first even statement by WHO was in August, and it was already then shocking everyone.","I think the nursing and midwifery leadership, had certain expectations, and did not understand WHO. WHO is not a lobbyist organization; it’s a technical organization. As a technical officer—the focus is on improving nursing and midwifery services in all health disciplines and not to act as lobbyist for the nursing and midwifery profession only. Because of this misconception, the nursing and midwifery community would feel that there was nothing being done in WHO, while inside WHO it was clear what was being done on nursing and midwifery. It is important that the nursing and midwifery leaders understand how WHO functions. In that way all could work better to improve the nursing and midwifery profession as a whole. For example, instead of pushing for one nurse in the organization they would encourage more nurses and midwives to join WHO in all its priority programs such as malaria and TB and all that. Then they would have a better chance of influencing health strategies and policies affecting nursing and midwifery. One person cannot do it by themselves. That’s what I think.",,,,,"Q: So here you are, five years later, actually in two countries, talking to nurses and midwives at all levels, from Ministry of Health to nurses in the Ebola treatment unit. What have you been thinking about and reflecting on? ","AMN: You know, nursing is a hands-on profession, and you never lose it, and somehow, even when I was in Geneva I was thinking, oh, I miss holding a baby, or I miss being at the bedside. But, of course, the roles evolve as you progress in your professional life. This opportunity here for me is like being closer to what I began to do as a nurse, being in touch with people, because in nursing, you have to be a people person. And really relating to people on common ground, and listening to what they go through, it’s really very emotional for me, it’s like going full circle, [laughs] as you are saying. Now we are back on the ground. Let’s see what we can do to help nurses, with that knowledge. When I’m talking to nurses and nurse leaders, I’m hearing them talking about protocols, those protocols we developed in Geneva, that they were being used, they were so helpful for them.","But I also feel sad because protocols only do not help much. It’s really how nurses respond, in terms of the support they get. Protocols will not heal the emotional wounds.  How do we make sure that, nurses on the frontline come out with less scars and continue serving? I see the emotions in the nurses we are talking to. They are willing to continue to serve as nurses, but are we supporting them enough for them to continue doing their work effectively? That is a question that I have to answer, and see how else we can mobilize resources in terms of support, as well as from their own governments to continue supporting them.",,"Q: So what have you identified as some major challenges, and what would you want to do next? ","AMN: There is need to look at individual nurses as persons, as individuals, because they have emotions, they have families. For us to keep them motivated, what policies can be put in place that really address their personal aspects? For example, we have to look at how they were working. Some of them worked so hard, they never rested. What policies can be put in place to ensure that they have some rest? They never saw their families. Is there a way that they can continue being in touch with their families? They shed tears, when they talk about having to be away from their families. Some of them had small children, like two to four years old. They never saw them in a long time. That is traumatic for a mother, not to be with their child. How else can our governments and organizations help to ensure such family interaction happen, while even controlling the risk of infection? At a personal level, there has to be something that really heals the wounds, or helps them to keep in touch with their families so that they are less stressed, less worried about what is happening at home. Although personal protection from infection succeeded, it’s that emotional part that needs to be resolved through appropriate policies and support.","There is also the issue of management.  Most of these nurses were really running the Ebola units. Management skills comes with a lot of aspects: issues of communication; conflict management; role definitions; assertiveness; being a leader. A program that addresses leadership skills, leadership and management skills for nurses would be important. Training shouldn’t happen once or as a one-off thing, it should be embedded in an in-service program with nurses enrolled from various levels. We always think that management and leadership is only necessary at a higher level. It’s not only at higher level; it should be at every level of nursing to some extent. ","Information gathering on Ebola is also very important. Nurses are supposed to record accurately, get information, relate it to others so that they know what is happening and how to respond. People say, “Oh, it’s research. It should not be for nurses.”  But when a nurse sees something at the center, if it is recorded and reported quickly, cases of Ebola would be identified earlier. So these aspects in the training curriculum should be strengthened. ","Lastly there are issues of advocacy, to sustain the momentum, especially with government. The Ebola outbreak took place, they resolved it, they moved on. But nurses and leaders in nursing associations, in the government institutions can continue with the advocacy at that level, to keep the momentum and remind populations that Ebola outbreak can happen again. They should make sure that disaster preparedness is instituted. If they can work on that, then they will be better prepared to respond next time should there be another Ebola crisis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n15,Victoria I. Roberts,Victoria,I,Roberts,Jennifer Dohrn,16-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,"Registered Nurse, Redemption Hospital, Communicable Disease Unit","Victoria Roberts is a registered nurse in the Communicable Disease Unit of Redemption Hospital in Monrovia Liberia. During the Ebola epidemic, Roberts served in an Ebola treatment unit as a frontline nurse.",Q: When did you first hear the words “Ebola Viral Disease”? Can you remember the first time as a nurse that you heard that there was a disease called this?,"VIR: My first time hearing about Ebola disease was in 2014. I heard of Ebola from Lofa, and that it was coming to the city of Monrovia. I had one of my nurses that worked at the emergency room come to Redemption Hospital, but we didn’t know that it was Ebola, and she contracted the virus. It began to spread within the whole hospital. A lot of people contracted the virus in the beginning, even a doctor, a foreign doctor from Uganda. He contracted the virus and he died. When we learned that it was Ebola, everybody began to take precautions.","By the time WHO [World Health Organization] came, there were a lot of people with Ebola. There was an outbreak in the city of Monrovia, and they decided to call us for a meeting. They told us that this virus can kill and how this virus operates within animals and within human beings. They began to lecture us and brought equipment for us to work with and people to train us. We saw that our people were dying. As mothers, we felt that all the children in the ward were our children, and we felt that the entire ward was our family. We saw that when it can go to another family, it can transfer to our family. So, we decided to rise up. We began to come together, to be united as women, and nurses, and we gave ourselves to WHO to train us to fight Ebola.",,,,Q: Can you describe what it was like to go into an Ebola Treatment Unit?,"VIR: We felt we were going in for a mission. So, the doctor, the whole team would go in as a team, and we would dress as a team. We put a mirror on the wall, always hanging. We made sure to dress with someone monitoring us to make sure there were no openings in our PPE [Personal Protective Equipment]. Everything had to be sealed up. Then we would look at ourselves in the mirror, and would make sure that we dressed properly. Before we went in, we would hold each and every one of our hands and give ourselves to God. We prayed as a team. We prayed as a team before going in.",,,,,,Q: Who was on the team going into the ETU?,"VIR: The nurse, the PA, the lab technician, and the hygienist. We would give them the IV. We would open the IV lines, each and every one of them. We would get [them] the medicine through their veins. We knew if we didn’t do it, they would die. The doctor was doing the assessment, the nurses were opening the IV lines, and the janitors were spraying on the ground. We were all making the best of things for the patients, trying to make them comfortable. When the nurses finished dosing, the patients were very weak, because the virus made them very weak. The virus made them tired, made them helpless. They were not even able to pick up a bottle of water to drink. But when you did your best to reach that patient, make sure that you fed them, make sure you got them even one bottle of water, it would ease their suffering.","We try to make them feel that they can make it, give them hope that they’re able to wake up again. We can only stay in our PPE for fifteen to twenty minutes, and that fifteen to twenty minutes, we are losing electrolytes. We are sweating profusely within the PPE. But we stayed because we wanted Ebola to stop within our country.",,Q: How did your family deal with the crisis and your work?,"VIR: When Ebola came, my husband was a hypertension patient, and everywhere within Monrovia the hospitals didn’t want to take anybody. They said it was Ebola. And because of Ebola, my husband began to worry, because he’s a hypertensive patient, and worrying will increase the hypertension. He needed O2, oxygen. He went to  another hospital. They didn’t want to take us. We went to  another hospital. No one want[ed] to take us. They said it was Ebola. I said, “No, it is not Ebola. If it’s Ebola, this is my ID card. I’m a nurse! I would have died, or I would have contracted the virus, but this is hypertension. Help me!” They were nowhere to help. When we got to Mawah in Vai Town, there was a clinic that I knew. But it was too late. ","So I was grieving when Ebola started, the outbreak getting rampant within Monrovia. I said to myself, even though my husband died, I must go into the ETU to work. So I must leave my children, my four children. The youngest one was six, the next one was eight, next one was twelve, and the oldest was eighteen. They began to obey me when I started doing my Ebola work. When I would come home later, I would tell them to put my water on the stove to get hot, and leave it on the porch, in the corner. Then, bring my clothes outside that I would wear when I came home. ","When I would come home, when they heard my voice, no one was allowed to run to me. Nobody could run to me to embrace me. No. They would remain in the house until I knocked and said, “Open the door.” When I would come home from work I would take my water off the fire and go in the back of the house, take a good bath, wash my uniform with chlorine and hang it up. Then I would knock on the door. Then they would open the door. As a mother, I go in but I wouldn’t sit close to them. If they wanted anything, I would tell them, “Go and get it in the house.” My children understood what was going on.",,,,,"Q: If you were asked to tell another country facing an epidemic, to tell the Ministry of Health an epidemic’s coming, what would be the parts that you would tell them to make sure to do for the nurses?","VIR: We need to encourage the nurses, motivate the nurses, see that their needs are met, because the nurses make something happen when they gather together. Because when there is no doctor, there’s a nurse there that represents the doctor. And when the doctor comes, the nurse informs the doctor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the Ebola epidemic, Severs and her team provided training and supplies to frontline nurses.",Q: What you were doing during the Ebola outbreak?,"GS: I’m the president for the Liberian Nurses Association. During the Ebola crisis, we did training, did a lot of training for the nurses and for people in the community, teaching how do to handwashing, how to prepare handwashing fluid. We also did some triage training, in one of the counties, to help us to create a triaging unit. ",,,,,Q: What did you learn through this crisis?,"GS: If we had just sat down and we had done nothing, we wouldn’t have gotten anywhere. The community was complaining, “We don’t have this. We don’t have PPE [personal protective equipment]. We don’t have gloves.” You can’t tell somebody to “Wash these decks,” for instance, and you don’t give the person soap, you don’t give the person water. How will they wash it? So. We are the ones who try to fend for these people, who are actually in the field doing the work. If things are provided, people can be able to carry out the work.  We were nursing leaders, nursing advocates.","Those are our responsibilities. But funding is a problem. We have no real source of funding from anywhere, besides what nurses pay for their membership.  Whatever they pay for the membership card is our only source of funding, no other source, nobody else helping us with anything. We got to run this place with just that.",,,,,Q: What are you most proud of?,"GS: Well—what makes me proud is we have chosen a profession, a profession where we save lives. When you have a patient who comes in very sick and you treat that patient and that patient can come through and walk out of the hospital, it’s a source of pride for you, that you have done something for that patient to recover. ",,,"Q: Today now, in 2019, have you seen a change in how the health system supports nurses? Is there a change that you see? Has nursing changed?","GS: There should be shared standards for public and private facilities. Some of the private areas don’t want to send their staff for the trainings. The training will be there but they won’t send them.  If we have trainings for everybody, it should be standard. It shouldn’t be something that, because it’s public, then it’s one and, because it’s private, it’s something else. The government needs to think on how they can standardize salaries as well. If you have a BSc degree in nursing—everybody who obtains that BSc should get that same kind of salary.","Nursing practices and precautions need to be standard as well.  During Ebola, we had an IPC [infection protection and control] focal person in certain areas. Let that be a standard, so that people can continue to do it, even without the crisis, so that, when another crisis comes, you’ll already be prepared. Community engagement also needs to continue. The community is where people come from, before they come to the hospital. If you have things that were put into place during the crisis, they should continue to have them in place in preparation. Like handwashing. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2018, Tarnue was one of five graduates in the first class of ophthalmic nurses to complete a year of intensive study at the New Sight Eye Center in Paynesville, Liberia. At ELWA, Tarnue was one of the first nurses to treat an Ebola patient in Liberia.",Q: How did you decide to become a nurse?,"HKT: Well, I decided to become a nurse to help my people, to help my country, Liberia. I started first as a nurse’s aide. I worked as a nursing aide for many years because there was no money for me to go to school. But then later, I started working at ELWA Hospital as a nurse’s aide, and then later on, I was offered a scholarship to go to nursing school, so I graduated and became a nurse.",,,,,Q: When did you actually see your first Ebola patient?,HKT: The first patient I saw was referred from Sierra Leone to our hospital. It was my first time seeing an Ebola patient. I was part of the first group that was trained to enter the Ebola Treatment Unit.,,,,,,Q: Can you walk me through what it was like working in the unit? Tell me what you did.,"HKT: When we went in, we would stay over an hour. We had to serve medication, feed the patients, and sit and look at them before coming out. Some of them were very weak and not able to feed themselves. We would clean them, take good care of them, change them, feed them, give them their medication, and then come out. I was the head for my shift.",,,Q: What was the process when you came out?,"HKT: The hygienist would spray you with chlorine water before you could take off the clothes. Then, you started taking off what you had on bit by bit, step by step. You take off the apron. You put it down. You took off the first—we all have three pairs of gloves. It’s not just one pair. Then you take off the apron. They spray you again. You had to be careful taking off the PPE not to touch the ordinary scrub guys. You have to be very careful. ","In serving medication, you have to be very careful, because of the needle, not to prick yourself, because some of the patients were combative. The patients might not want to take the medication because they are so down-hearted. You have to take your time, talk to them. Even if you’re giving them the food, they didn’t want to drink or to eat their food. So we would talk to them, encourage them, give them their medication. You can’t just take the medication and leave it. ",,,,,,Q: What happened when someone died?,"HKT: It broke my heart. Because can you imagine? One time, when I entered the unit, a boy had his phone and his mother was calling him. He was lying on the bed, so helpless and weak. I saw that his mother was calling his phone, so I took the phone with my gloves to put it to his ear so he could listen to his mother. But then after five minutes, he passed out. Can you imagine? The mother called back. I had to tell her that her son had just died. It was not easy in there. It was terrible. I had close family that died in that Ebola unit.",,,,Q: Tell me about your family—what did they think of you working in this treatment unit?,"HKT: I told my husband, my mother, and my father, and they said “No. You’re not able to work in the Ebola unit.” They said it was dangerous to go in the unit. I said “well, I have to go there to work, because I’m not worried that you people will catch Ebola, but if any of my extended family catches Ebola, how will I help them if I’m not there?” I tried to educate them. I said “you won’t catch it, but I’m there to help other people that are in need of me, so let me risk my life to help my Liberian people.” I was there to encourage them. I encouraged my husband. I said, I’m a health worker. I took an oath, so I need to serve my people. I said the MSF [Doctors Without Borders] is calling me for my interview. Please allow me to do it. At last, they agreed to the MSF interview, and I passed, and I started working in the unit.",,,,,,"Q: Once Ebola was ending, what happened next with healthcare at your hospital?","HKT: As ELWA Hospital personnel, we are still doing it. Wash your hands. We take your temperature before you enter. We ask you a lot of questions. Do you have fever? Yes. How many days? You show us. We mark it. We do your temperature flash. We monitor the temperature, whether it’s very high. Are you bleeding? No. Are you breathing fast? No. Do you have diarrhea? We ask all these questions at ELWA. The process is still going on at ELWA hospital.",,,Q: Those are lessons that helped change how healthcare is given.,"HKT: The healthcare system has improved greatly, because we are experienced from Ebola. But people are quick to forget. You know that most people right now, if they come to the hospital, and you tell them to wash their hands, they have a problem with it. They don’t want to wash their hands. We have to keep the health system going. We have to continue the hand-hygiene because it’s for our own good health to wash our hands. It’s important. Keep your hands clean. But some people have a problem with it. They already have forgotten what Ebola did, you see? We still have to keep the health system going. We have to still encourage them for hand-hygiene. It’s very important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grant Mental Health Hospital and ELWA Hospital, both in Monrovia, Liberia. Harries was part of the team at ELWA which treated some of the earliest Ebola patients seen in Monrovia. Later, Harries was hired by Médecins Sans Frontières Belgium to serve in its Ebola treatment unit.","Q: In 2014, can you tell me where you were working, what your role was during the Ebola outbreak?","JH: In 2014, I was working with ELWA Hospital. I was playing a nursing role. Then later on, we were trained—after we heard about Ebola—we heard about Ebola in Lofa County [Liberia]. Then the management of the institution decided to train all of the nurses. ELWA was the first hospital to establish an ETU [Ebola treatment unit]. ",,,,,Q: And your role?,"JH: I received a call over the weekend from my supervisor, that I needed to make myself available to work, along with all of our doctors. This was not an easy thing. That Saturday morning, when I went to work, Dr. Deddi checked on the schedule and said: “Harries, you’re the lead nurse. You need to get set, so we can go in.” My heart started beating. Then she went to dress. Then I went to dress. When I got to dressing, I decided to pray. When I got through praying, we started to form a line to go in. We received all of the instruction, those things that we needed to do when we get in. So—",,,,,,"Q: —when you got there that day and were told, “You have to go in,” what you meant by going in is putting on the full PPE [personal protective equipment]—",JH:  Yes.,,,Q: —and going into a red zone.,"JH:  Yes. Dr. Deddi decided to lead a team. Right after Deddi should have been the nurse. Right after the nurse should have been the aide. But right after Dr. Deddi, I decided to stay at the back and give chance to the aide. And aide was in front of me. When we got in, we began to talk. Then what really motivated me—when I saw Dr. Deddi giving aid to the first Ebola patient that we receive in Monrovia. I got motivated.",,,,,,,Q: What more did you do there?,"JH: I decided to apply to Belgian MSF. They took me. And I started playing both a nursing and a mental health role. When I enter the ETU, if I see somebody having frequent bowel movement, I report the case immediately. Those who are depressed, I give them psychosocial counseling. ",,,,"Q: So with the mental health services, you were sitting and talking with patients? Are there any patients or experiences from providing that psychosocial support that stand out in your memory?","JH: Yes. I interacted with a patient. She died. She was six months pregnant. We got to talking on my first shift. She and I are from the same ethnic group. I told her if there is any problem she’s having, she should wait for me because we go in three times a day. When I got through talking with her, I came outside. The following day, I was on first shift. But when I went to meet her, she was already dead.",,,,,,"Q: I’m sorry. What helped you—your mental health—what helped you to keep going? What helped you personally to keep going, to be willing to live at the compound? ","JH: God was the source of my strength. Because I can remember one morning I was going to the ETU and then I received a call from one of my students, that she had a relation infected with the Ebola virus.",,,Q: One of the nursing students.,"JH: And one of my colleagues had just died. When I got to the ETU—I was not really feeling fine that whole day. I took the phone and called my pastor. He decided to pray for me and saidy, “It will be well with you.” When the time came for us to enter, I held my friend’s hand, with god to pray. Immediately when I entered the ETU, my whole goggles went dark. And once you feel uncomfortable, you have to come out, with the entire team. When my goggles got clear, I told them that I was not feeling comfortable. That whole day, I was thinking on what she told me. Actually, I was depending on God in the ETU.",,,"Q: So that day, you came back out and you were thinking about it. What made you go back in?","JH: Yes!

Prior to the Ebola epidemic, Kamara worked at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center. During the epidemic, Kamara served in an Ebola treatment unit set up by the Ministry of Defense.",Q: Can you talk about when you first moved from your work as a staff nurse at JFK into the Ebola Treatment Unit? Can you go back in time to the first few days that you were there and talk about that?,"JWK: It was so traumatic. It was so traumatic. My experience as a staff nurse was completely different than in the ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit] because in the ETU, everyone was afraid. Everything was traumatizing. You would be on duty. You’d be at the triage, the screening area, screening patients, and you would see a friend, another nurse come in, infected and helpless. Because if you see your friend infected, the next thing that will come to your mind is, “Who’s next? Could it have been me?” ",I always told people I really don’t know what took me into work at the ETU. This is my profession. This is my calling. I must go and serve. ,"Another day I can never forget was when our late doctor, Dr. Abraham Bobo, went into the ETU.  He took off his rings. He told us, he said, “Tell my wife to be strong.” He said, “Tell my wife to be strong.” This is a person who always used to mentor us, give us advice, telling us, “Ah, you guys need to take precaution.” I mean, seeing him get infected and into the ETU, that was so horrible for us.","One of my worst experiences was when we had this mother come in. She came with four babies, and the five of them died in sequence. When her last child was dying, I remember her words to me clearly, “I’m helpless, and how can I help you?” I was the nurse—and it was my patient saying this. She’s just going to die, and now my hands will go out empty.",,Q: How was the nurse’s role different from the doctor’s role?,"JWK: If you’re looking at caring for a patient, everything lies in the hands of nurses.  Ebola stopped first, because number one, God decided to stop the pestilence he put on us. And two, the force from the nursing work, from the nursing and midwife workforce. Because if it were only doctors we were depending on to go into ETU, trust me, we’d still have Ebola. But the nursing and midwifery workforce, they were the heroes and heroines who fought Ebola.",,,,,,"Q: Any time along the way, did you feel silenced from telling your story? Or did you feel like you could talk about what had happened, and your experience as a nurse?","JWK: Sometimes I just don’t want to tell people I was in the Ebola fight. If you start to talk up your story it brings up—it will bring up fear, which is good so people will start to take the necessary precautions. So sometimes I really want to talk about it because it reminds us not to forget that we were hit, and we can still be hit again in the future. All we need is a proper system, monitoring, evaluation. We must be able to track. We know this. And the sad thing about Ebola, the signs and symptoms are not directly fixed to a specific illness. Malaria is a prevalent illness and carries all Ebola symptoms. So, we just have to ask questions. Have you traveled in recent times? Did you attend any burial of any unusual death? We need to ask these questions. ",,,Q: What helped you to keep going?,"JWK: We had a team built up. We already had this working relationship. It’s like, I need to watch your back. You need to watch my back. Because [if] one man goes down, everyone goes down. It was a team effort. That kept me going, kept me encouraged. That was the resilient force that we had that kept us going.","And we can only have it when the health ministry enforces action and gives strength to our Ebola nurses. They need to recognize that we nurses are the arm behind a good health system and understand that nurses need to be prioritized in this country. A nursing force needs to be strong. If you go to other countries, the people prioritize the nurses. Because we spent more time in all our efforts behind patient care than a doctor. A doctor comes and they prescribe and he or she goes. But if I’m not there too, whatever you prescribe, your prescription won’t be carried out. If you look at prescription and care, like sixty percent of the work is left with nursing and midwifery. So, all we need to do is to put in more time, provide those requisite materials for the nurses to work with.","I hope that we could have specialized nursing practices in Liberia. If I want to be a pediatric nurse, I’d be able to specialize in pediatrics. If I want to be an OB/GYN nurse, I can specialize. I have high interest in being a nutritionist, but there is no school here that offers nutrition. I don’t even think we have ten persons who are nutritionists in Liberia. I don’t really know if we have some. I would like us to have nursing within all areas. It gives us more strength to spread our wings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, I’m working with the Ministry of Health [& Social Welfare] in the health promotion division. I’m a health promotion officer, and I engage in community activities and creating awareness. ","At that time, there was so much denial about Ebola.  People couldn’t believe that Ebola could kill and people can survive from Ebola.  I’m one of those that survived Ebola. I told my story to people, with community engagement, so they could understand. People started to know what can happen—if you go for treatment sooner, the better you will recover from Ebola. I worked from county to county talking to people, meeting with the chief, meeting with stakeholder to talk to them about Ebola, every community to talk to them about Ebola.  I think we’re four survivors on our team.",I was the first nurse that survived.,,,Q: Wow. ,"KSB: Yes, the first nurse that survived. So that’s when the Ministry said, “Wow, then you can help us.” And then a few other people, NGOs [non-governmental organization] said the same thing. They started coming around and then I started giving them my story and then we used to go from place to place talking to people, “You can survive.” At that time, they wanted us to pray. People were just dying. No control. People just dying. So, there after I started going from community to community, from county to county talking to people, and they listened. I told them, “You can make it. The sooner you go, they will provide medication for you, but it is not for Ebola. It’s just there to support you and help.” So, we started going from place to place, counseling people that you can go there, you can survive Ebola, and then so on.",,,,,,Q: And the reason you contracted the Ebola was because you are in contact with the patients whom you were nursing? ,"KSB: Yes, yes. ",,,Q: Both of whom you didn’t know that they were Ebola cases?. ,"KSB: No one knew that Ebola is very fast. When a person dies, that’s when the virus spreads. Well, no one knew that message. The Ministry of Health, where I am now, is responsible for developing a health intervention message. So that’s why we changed the message because when a person died from Ebola and then you’re there, you will contract the virus quickly because the virus immediately transfers from the deceased to you. So the message changed. At that time, we only knew one message—headache, fever, and you will do this, this and that will happen to you. But after I came from the unit, the Ministry of Health changed that whole message that they shouldn’t touch a dead body. The dead body of an Ebola patient is dangerous. If someone died in your community, don’t touch the body.",,,,,,,Q: And it seemed most of the people still didn’t know about this risk of Ebola.,"KSB: No. At that time, the risk of Ebola really that no one knew.  Or they knew, but they were in a denial stage about whether it was true, this sickness can really kill. People already knew the trauma I went through, but they just felt that the Ministry of Health was lying. ","And then the Muslim people, you know, before when someone died, they will wash the body too. Well, in one place in the far country, they did that. When the imam died, they went and bathed the imam too. All of those that bathed that imam, those men died. They died. So people started to believe, believe that when someone died, don’t touch their body. The body is very dangerous. That’s how the whole message changed on Ebola. The body is a danger. ",,,"Q: Your story is unbelievable—that you’re sitting here today alive and you’re trying to help other people to survive by saying, “You know you can actually make it.” And you did it. After you were discharged, how did other people behave towards you? ","KSB: It was bad.  I was stigmatized. But my husband at that time and my family, they really supported me. You will have other friends that will stigmatize you, but when your family really supports you, you will not have time for anybody. I just asked myself, if God can make me survive Ebola, then I will not take anybody stigmatizing me.  I prayed to God, let me do what I can do for a lot of people to survive Ebola. I went on the radio station, talked to people about Ebola from radio station to another radio station and telling my story and then people were listening and taking my advice. So, even friends I knew that we used to eat together, do everything together, they went away from me. But, my family supported me, the division I’m working with in the Ministry of Health supported me, and the hospital I worked with, other nurses all supported me.

Was there a way to say goodbye?,"MWD: When the patient dies, you don’t call in family and say “Come for your body,” because if you do, you don’t know how they are going to go about burying. The burial team would collect the body and then go bury it. Before collecting the body, you would call the family and tell them the patient had been in the ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit] and had expired. We could not give them the body because that could expose a lot of people. ",,,,,,,Q: Can you talk about how you got support every day to do what you did? ,"MWD: We were doing this work for our relatives, our friends, our sisters, our brothers, because just for the salary, we would not work. I’m not risking my life, leaving my children, my husband, I was not doing that for pay, I was doing that for the sake of my people. ",,,,"Q: Can you talk about the importance of being trained in, in protective equipment?","MWD: We need to be trained. We need to be better trained as nurses, so that when there is an outbreak, we know how to engage that. We actually need to be trained in and out of Liberia. With our work in the ETU, we need to work out of this country to be well-trained.  ",,,,,,Q: Do you see that the—the things that nurses learned in terms of training for Ebola practices are still being maintained in the hospital?,"MWD: Yes. We learned how to wear our gloves, we learned how to wear our full PPE, and we learned how—for each patient that we treat, between patients, we learned to change gloves. It was in ’14, our equipment that we work with, we learned where to place it, because you can finish giving somebody medication, and they touch everything around you. We learned how to monitor our IPC [Infection Prevention and Control]. It is what we learned doing the training during Ebola. We tried to implement the practices, but we really needed more training. ",,,"Q: Do you feel that the remarkable work you did every day, do you and your fellow nurses feel you were recognized?","MWD: Yes. But still with all our efforts —you know, we risked our lives—we don’t hear anybody say, “Oh, Matilda, because of your work, because of your effort, because you risked your life, we want you to go out there to gain more knowledge.” And there’s no recognition, no encouragement, no recommendation, no I love you. ",Q: Do you think there’s a connection between what you are able to do as a nurse and the fact that you are a woman? Is there a relationship between how you grew up as a young girl and your view of women’s responsibilities? And that you are now a nurse leader?,"MWD: Well, when I was growing up, if I understand your questions, I thought before I can become a woman, before I can become somebody in the field, I have to go to school to learn and put myself in a category where people will recognize me. Where I will work in the community to save my family, my friends, my neighborhood, then I have to go to school, to be on the frontline.",Q: Who gave you that?,MWD: Courage. ,,,,,Q: That direction?,"MWD: I just thought to myself. I knew that coming from a very poor background, I’ve got to do something that will help my family, my brothers and sisters. I had to do something to help them, and even to help my community as well. ",,Q: Amazing. Is there anything else you want to say about your experiences as a nurse on the frontline during Ebola?,"MWD: During my experience of God, I really learned a lot of things—how to protect myself, how to prevent myself from coming in contact with a lot of diseases. I really learned plenty of things, how to protect myself, so I wouldn’t die because of the infections. If I got a case or any outbreak, I know how to go about protecting myself first before saving life. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n22,Mawah Kamara Verdier,Mawah,Kamara,Verdier,Margaret Loma Phiri,15-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,"Registered Nurse; Treasurer, Liberian Nurses Association","Mawah Verdier is the Treasurer for the Liberian Nurses Association. In addition to her training as a registered nurse, she holds a bachelors degree in sociology, and is pursuing a masters degree in peace and conflict studies. At the start of the Ebola epidemic, she became actively involved in educating the community, fundraising, and training nurses to work in Ebola treatment units. Verdier also joined an Ebola treatment unit run by Doctors without Borders. She worked in an ambulance team that helped to transport patients needing medical attention from surrounding communities to the treatment unit.",Q: How long have you been a nurse?,"MKV: I’ve been a nurse since 1999. I graduated from the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts, which is TNIMA. It’s a formal institution at the J.F.K. Medical Center [in Monrovia, Liberia], where I went to school. ",,,,,Q: You had mentioned that you also did a B.A. [Bachelor of Arts] in Sociology? Why did you move to social sciences?,"MKV: As a nurse, I realized that not everyone who comes to the hospital needs medicine. They may have some social issue, or some family related issue. I developed an interest in how I can interact with people who may not have a medical condition through medicine?  I needed to know when to treat and when to talk, when to counsel. That’s when I really decided to study sociology at the University of Liberia.","After I graduated in 2011, I work with Médecins Sans Frontières [Doctors without Borders] as a social mobilizer and as a nurse, in the intensive care unit. I also worked with them as an Ebola nurse in the ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit]. When MSF recruited us, at first I was on the ambulance. I started picking up Ebola patients from every community in Monrovia. I used to work sometimes twenty-four hours, sometimes two, three, four days without going home.  The first time I visited an ETU, I said, “I need to visit and see.” When I entered that ETU, that’s when I gathered the courage. I mustered courage to work in the ETU, to help the people that were dying. And, when we started going there, we had more patients being discharged, as compared to when just the expatriates were there working.  It was MSF that trained us on how to use the PPE, do’s and don’t’s about how to dress and undress. And how to enter the ETU, how to take the patient, when you don’t know if he or she is positive.  How to collect the patient from the community, how to disinfect the area that the patient was in. ",,,,,Q: What was the role of the government at that time? What was the government doing?,"MKV: Initially there was no coordination between the association and the government. But during the outbreak, the government provided funds through the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and that funding was what helped the association to train nurses to identify Ebola patients, to be aware of the signs and symptoms, to know the cardinal signs that you watch for, and to be able to know when to refer a patient, or who to call if you notice three of these signs. Government was also able to make transportation for nurses that were assigned to a different ETU. Initially there was no transportation for them. Public transport was refusing nurses. They were refusing nurses, they never wanted to give them a ride to wherever they were going. Once they saw you, they’d say, “Oh, Ebola people.”",,,"Q: So, what do you think were some of the challenges that you experienced during that time?","MKV: Challenges? Communication, and culture barrier. That really challenged us. And then religious belief, we had a real challenge in that area. Especially when the government came out and made a popular pronouncement that they were going to start cremating Ebola bodies. People became very stubborn, even when they would know that a patient has all the signs and symptoms, they would tell you, “No, my patient is not going. I don’t want you to burn the body.” And some of them, “No, I’m a Muslim. We don’t believe in this.” And some, “No, I’m a Christian. We don’t do this.” And, “No, in my culture, this is taboo.” It was really, really difficult. Because, in our society, we are not aware of cremating bodies. It is strange for us, but during the outbreak. We had to do it, to reduce the spread of the virus. They thought we were wicked. The medical team, the leadership, the government, we all were wicked people. That’s what we had to do to reduce the spread of Ebola, even though it was traumatizing for even us. ",,,,,,,Q: What sort of communication studies or methods were put in place to be able that you were all moving together?,"MKV: We did not dare use the radio. We used megaphones, we used posters, we used photos. Then we used some of the community members, who could speak the different dialects in different communities. And then we encouraged the religious groups also, to make it part of their sermon. So, like on Friday, if you go to the mosque, they used ten minutes, twenty minutes to educate the people. If you went to church, used ten, twenty minutes to educate the people. So, all the churches, the mosques, they all got informed through the team. ",,,,"Q: From all this and your own personal experience, what do you think made the most difference? ","MKV: What made a difference is the training, the training. When you are not trained to do things as a professional person, it’s difficult. You may try, but you will not do it to the best of your ability. ",,,,,,"Q: Being a nurse and president or treasurer of the association, what do you think we should be thinking about?","MKV: We need to tell the story of nurses. We are at the frontline. More nurses die because we are the first, at the entry point of every facility. And that’s what gave me courage to go to the ETU, because nurses were dying. In other eras, people die through war. Nurses die more, with nurses in the frontline. ","We also should set a standard that can be globally accepted.  So that once you are a nurse in Liberia, you should be able to work with the same standard anyplace around the world. Because, professionally speaking, we’ve got to have continual professional development. I would encourage other nurses to build their confidence and competency, to be able to perform to the best of their ability. We should stop and improve the learning environment for nurses, because we want competent nurses. We want qualified nurses. We want nurses that will be confident of themselves, and not just going to wear white.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to working long hours in the unit, she conducted outreach in her community, working to encourage those exhibiting symptoms to seek help.","Q: Yes. Can you tell me when you first learned about the outbreak? When you first learned about it, where were you, what were you doing? Do you remember?","MJM: The first time I came across a patient was a pregnant woman. Well, I did not know it was Ebola. She came from the OPD [outpatient department]. Her skin was very hot. When she came, because she was in labor and her skin was hot, the OPD midwives, they were in the labor room. I heard she died before I came—I came the next day, she died. She never delivered. And she died with the pregnancy. And that was my first experience.",,,,,Q: And how did you go from working in the midwifery department to the ETU? ,"MJM: They were recruiting nurses; they needed nurses to go up to help. So my girlfriend called to tell me that the people needed nurses to go in the ETU, and she asked me if I would be—if I would like to be there. I said, no problem. It’s teamwork. We have to save life. It could be any of my relatives, dead on that day, and I hold myself responsible, so I told her, I said, “Put my name down, I’ll go.”",,,,,,"Q: Psychologically, socially, who supported you to keep going?","MJM: It was my husband. He was afraid but later on he’d say, “I know you can make it, Soko.” My children. They got afraid and told me, “Mommy, don’t go there.” I said, “No, no. I went to school, I took oaths, I have to help. Somehow, some way, I should be part of this crisis. So I have to go.”",,,"Q: What about the community, the wider community? Your neighbors, your friends?","MJM: I met the chairman of the community to tell him I should be informed if we have any patients. Because we don’t want an outbreak in the community. If anything, I will call the ambulance to carry the patient to the hospital. I went all around with a microphone, telling people not to treat any patient at home. Anybody sick, go to the hospital.  And after that, the community, they—they told me thank you for what I did. So our community was safe. We have our washing-hand buckets all around the community. If I do not see the bucket, I will demand you to put a bucket there to wash your hands.",,,,,,,"Q: I know there were a few lockdowns. You still went to work, during those lockdowns. The health workers still went home and came back to the ETU.","MJM: We had a bus to carry us to work, but when we started, there was no bus. We used to transport ourselves.",,,,"Q: If you had the opportunity to talk to the head of the World Health Organization, what would you want them to know?","MJM: I want them to know that they should pay more attention to health workers all over the world. If the health worker is well taken care of, they will work more, they will be moved. I want for the whole world to pay attention to health workers. They are not paying attention to us, seriously. They are not paying attention.","If you cannot pay your health worker well, she will not want to do well. If we continue like this, it will be too bad for us, because most of the nurses are working two, three jobs at a time.

Cooper Tokpah currently works at the Ministry of Health in Liberia, coordinating health services for Montserrado County. Before the Ebola epidemic began, she worked as a midwife and a nurse at Clara Town Health Center, serving as the supervisor for maternal and child health. She began supervising the JFK Ebola Treatment Unit in March of 2014 where she oversaw 500 staff and managed resources to treat patients.","Q: Can we go back in time, and can you describe where you were working during the Ebola outbreak?","PCT: Okay. During the Ebola outbreak, 2014, I was first assigned to the Clara Town Health Center in Clara Town. I reported to the Health Supervisor. I’m a midwife and a nurse, and was the supervisor for the facility when it came to mother and child health. ","When Ebola entered the country, I was still working in the labor room. Women were coming for delivery, but people were also shying away. Health workers were shying away too, fearing the unseen, anything we couldn’t see.",,,,Q: They were shying away because they had heard about it?,"PCT: They had never seen Ebola, even though we learned about it in school. It was completely strange. Our health system wasn’t that strong, even though the community was trying. We still had a shortage of supplies.",,,,,,"Q: What kinds of supplies, specific supplies, were in short supply?","PCT:  IPC supplies, the infection prevention control supplies. We also talked about the state of mind you had to have to be safe to serve.",,,Q: What about training?,"PCT: There was no training. Health workers were embedded into the services just like that. We weren’t prepared to handle a case when it came to supplies--gloves, the gowns, the masks, the shields, the boots and other things, that we have now because of the Ebola crisis.  So people started to die. ",,,,,,,Q: What was the reaction in the community?,"PCT: The community never trusted us because they felt we were lying, that we brought the disease, and were killing the people. We felt trapped.",,,,Q: You felt trapped.,"PCT: Yes, trapped. I have lost relevance in my community. Now, I’m at the facility level. People wanted to burn the facilities because they couldn’t trust the health system anymore. They felt they were part of the disease. They were blaming the government. I said the only thing I can do is go into the fight. People were starting to come to Liberia, bringing supplies, training us how to use them, how to treat, how to be confident of ourselves. So I say I think this is the savviest place.",,,,,,Q: The savviest place. So people were coming together?,"PCT:  People were coming together now to see how to fight. I decided to go into the fight. I discussed it with my husband. My husband said you don’t want to go in the fight. Ebola isn’t easy, nurses are dying, and nurses are the conduit of disease to their family, because they are the frontliners. If they come in contact with the disease, they take it back to their family, and then the children, especially the children are closer to their mothers, so he seemed unhappy, didn’t want me to go. So then I kept quiet. I just kept quiet. Something was just telling me to go. I don’t know what was, just that internal drive.",,,Q: You weren’t afraid?,"PCT: The nurses couldn’t contend with the overload of patients. People were all on the street laying down. But seeing the other nurses made me want to get into the fight, that we had to do it. ",,,"Q: Later, you became a manager.","PCT: Yes. From that point in time, I started to manage the ETU. I managed over 500 staff.",,,,,Q: Five-hundred staff?,"PCT: Staff! I had doctors, I had nurses. I was working with the team from Uganda, Dr. Atta and her team. They said don’t be afraid. You will make it. ",,Q: So you coordinated—,"PCT: Coordinated everything. Supplies. Make sure there’s food, clothing, water, drugs, fluids, that everything is in place. Make sure my staff is paid on good time. Make sure the payrolls are clean. Make sure I submit my payroll on time. Meetings. But I’m a nurse also. ","Yes, I’m a nurse.

Medical waste had not been evacuated, so the infection began to grow among the staff, some of my staff started coming down with the virus. At the ETU, I lost three of my staff at JFK, two security—four. One doctor and one laboratory technician. I lost two hygienists. ",,,,"Q: Ah, okay. You lost a lot.","PCT: We had to divide the staff into two. In Liberia, I’m the first female manager. Because I went, other females came, so I was a motivating force.",,,Q: You became a mentor for other nurses.,"PCT: Yes, we were also mentoring other ETUs about the secrets of care. We’re using IV fluids, we’re using everything to fight back. Some would die, but by the grace of God, we had a lot of survivors in a short period of time. ",,Q: But why do you think there wasn’t enough recognition for all that you accomplished?,"PCT: People like to take the glory all by themselves, not recognizing we were all on a team and forgetting that we were women, the first to get into the fight.",,Q: What was your home life like? ,"PCT: I go until two, three in the morning, I don’t sleep at night, my children cannot be played with because I have the Ebola care, I’m in the ETU. My husband and I couldn’t have intimacy.",,,"Q: But still, you were a team in the fight.","PCT: I’m a nurse, yes, but we separate our rooms. When I come from work at night, I go and take a bath outside while people are sleeping, use my chlorine, go into my room quietly, and I tell my husband good morning neighbor.

That must have felt very lonely.,"PCT: Yes, you just stay away to yourself.",,Q: What helped you to keep going?,"PCT: At some point in time, I really wanted to leave the ETU, but how? People saw me. That why they came. People were dying. The whole team was broken down, so I couldn’t leave.",,Q: You were seen as the manager.,"PCT: I was tasked to show by example that we keep going and fighting. As people die, still talk to them. We bury them. We talk to the family. They would cry. Got to keep moving. Got to keep moving. We held hands together and prayed.",,Q: That was helpful? ,"PCT: Yes. What we were able to do for each other was to create a survivor tree, an artificial tree with ribbons tied on to it.  Black for death, but there was only one black ribbon. Those who survive get pink. The heroes get white. Then we carved the names on the box, each and every one of them is there.",,,,,Q: So your name is carved on the box.,"PCT: Carved on the box.  With a white ribbon. It’s in the museum [National Museum of Liberia] . If you go, you ask for the ETU survival tree from the MOD. ",,Q: Beautiful.,"PCT: Yes, just to remember us because we want to be recognized.

When the Ebola epidemic began, she began working at Redemption Hospital, helping to establish the Ebola Treatment Unit there. During the outbreak, she treated patients and helped coordinate the response of the ETU with Alan Hospital and ELWA. She currently works as a midwife at Redemption Hospital.",,"SWM: When we started with Ebola, I was at Redemption Hospital, where they established an ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit]. But the ETU got packed, and there were no beds, no space. Some patients would die right there, or be taken back home. Ebola was spreading fast. Later on, the Redemption Hospital became the holding center, so that when a patient was taken to ELWA [ELWA Hospital], and there was no space, they will come to Redemption. We had over 100 patients. Ebola work is a team work, unique team work. No one, two, or three people could go alone into the unit. ",,,,,Q: And who was on the team?,"SWM: The team had hygienists, nurses, supervisors, doctors, and PAs [physician assistants]. When you enter the unit, before you come out of the unit, there’s a sprayer sitting there, and the sprayer will spray you up and down. Then you go to the mirror to undress. Take off the gloves, take off the mask. From the beginning, it wasn’t easy. It’s not easy to wear PPE. You have to tie your nose, seal up your whole face. Even if you wear the PPE for just ten or fifteen minutes, you will be soaked with sweat. When you came out of the unit, and you were sprayed and undressed, you showered, changed all your clothes, and wore new clothes.",,,,,,"Q: How long would you be in the unit with this? How long would you stay in the unit, the team, with this equipment on?","SWM: It depends on what you were supposed to do. As soon as we entered, the hygienist would be cleaning up. Those who are supposed to take blood will be taking blood. Those who are supposed to hang fluid will be hanging fluid. Those who are supposed to serve medication will be serving medication. Sometimes I spent an hour because I had to give fluid and wait for that fluid to flow.",,,Q: And the team left as a whole unit also? ,"SWM: We entered together and kept all together. The motto was, “keep safe and keep savvy.”",,,,,,,"Q: How did you emotionally support yourself, emotionally, that you could then go in every day?","SWM: At the beginning of the Ebola, I didn’t want to work. I didn’t really want to work, because I have my grandchildren in the house. But when I heard that more people were dying, and the Ministry of Health was appealing for all nurses to come onboard, I said I made a vow, and I need to fulfill this vow. I made a vow to save life. I had four children. I’m a widow -- my husband was killed in 1990 as a result of the war, and the children were very little. They did not know their father. But now, they are men and women. ",,,,Q: Can we talk a little bit about pregnant women? Did they have anywhere to go for antenatal care?,SWM: No.,,,,,,Q: Everything was shut down.,"SWM: No antenatal care, no HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] unit. Only Ebola centers were open. All the health facilities were closed. The private clinics that were open, they were taking risks, and people were getting infected. All the hospitals, the big hospitals, were closed. Even those who were on HIV treatment couldn’t get their treatment. Even if you had malaria, you would hide yourself, so you would not be carried to the Ebola unit. ",,,Q: What did a pregnant woman do if there was nowhere to go?,"SWM: They were giving birth in their homes. If you were in a community, and you knew of a midwife, you would just go to the midwife. There was a lot of risk. ",,,Q: And what did you have to do to rebuild the maternity unit? ,"SWM: They needed to decontaminate, and the patients started flowing in again. [snaps] But we still have an isolation unit at Redemption. If we suspect you have Ebola, we send you to the isolation unit.",,,,,Q: So that’s a lesson from Ebola. Something you learned from Ebola is to keep that.,"SWM: When we deliver, we are still wearing PPE. We are still taking precautions. We are still hand-washing with chlorine. We still use hand sanitizers. ",,"Q: So looking back at all of this, with everything you learned and all the care you provided, what would you recommend to a country whose preparing for an epidemic? ","SWM: Create awareness.

During the outbreak, we were encouraged to go to the treatment center to help the government. I worked as a volunteer nurse in the treatment center. Before we were sent, they trained us in IPC [infection prevention and control]. I worked at Hastings Ebola Treatment Center during Ebola outbreak.",,,,,Q: Can you tell me a bit more about being encouraged and then volunteering? What was that like?,"PT: Well, really, it was not easy, as soon as people knew that you were working in an Ebola treatment center, people discouraged you. The stigma was painful. My landlord and my neighbors even went to the police.  I was not treating any patients, but because of stigma, most of them went around saying that I had patients because I was working in a treatment center. My landlord even decided to give me notice. I was totally isolated. Nobody would come near me. ",,,,,,"Q: And then you started to work in the treatment center. Could just describe what it was like working at that time, your experiences, what you learned, anything, what you saw, what you felt?","PT: Working in the Ebola treatment center at that crucial time, it was very scary. My family abandoned me, because they already concluded that I had made up my mind to die. My first day at the treatment center, I was asked to go and give IV [intravenous] fluid to one of the Ebola patients. The patient was not in a bed, so I had to look around for her and I met her taking a bath. After she finished taking a bath, I helped take her to the bed. I tried to set the IV line and saw that I had a splash of vomitus on me. But I had on a full PPE, which is the personal protective [equipment] gear. Even though I was safe, my in-charge quarantined me for one week. ",,,Q: And that was your first day.,"PT: That was my first day! So that very day, I couldn’t go home. After one week, they did a blood test. I was negative. The next day, I went home. There was a rumor going around that I have contracted Ebola virus, which was not true. People were not accepting us nurses.",,,,,,,Q: Even your family?,"PT: Even our families. When I gave them money, I put it on the floor before they took it. Many people were homeless because of working in a treatment center. They were given notice. Even if you’ve got money you want to give your family, they would reject it. ",,,,"Q: You talked a lot about the isolation and the stigma. For you, as a nurse working in the treatment center, did that change over time? Did the isolation and the stigma, did that get worse, get better?","PT: In the beginning, it got worse, because the disease was out of control. People were not observing the IPC protocol, to use hand sanitizer or wash your hands whenever you are in contact with someone, or in contact with any object. This IPC method really helped to minimize the transmission of Ebola virus. Without this sensitization, I think Ebola would have still remained.  I also worked with confirmed cases, and in that type of treatment unit, the burden was much higher.",,,,,,Q: The burden?,"PT: Yes. Because we had to be very protective. With the slightest mistake, you contract Ebola. I can remember one kid who was also an Ebola victim. He escaped from the treatment unit to the nurses’ room, the staff room, and storeroom where the drugs are kept. This little boy, nobody knew where he came from. We failed to realize that he was from the treatment center, in the unit. The child came in and was with us. Even touched many of us. But by then, he had been, I think, two months in the treatment center. If it takes two months, or one month, they take your sample and re-test you. If you are negative, they will give you another chance. After two weeks, they do the last check. If you are negative then, then you will be discharged. So fortunately, the boy’s result was on the way, and the result was negative. If not, every one of us would have contracted the Ebola virus. So the experience was so much. The experience was so much.",,,Q: What is your proudest moment? What are you most proud of?,"PT: What I am most proud of is we succeeded. The Hastings Ebola Treatment Center, if I remember, was one of the renowned treatment centers in Sierra Leone. We discharged a large number of survivors. Every month, we survived, and we discharged about forty or fifty. We discharged the survivors to go home. We took them home. And the other thing I am proud of is that only one staff member among us that caught Ebola virus, contracted Ebola virus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She received an award from the President of Sierra Leone for her service during the outbreak. ,Q: How long have you been a nurse?,"AFC: I was trained between 2007 and 2011, and I started working at Lakka Government Hospital in March 2019 as a state and rural community health nurse (SECH).",,,,,Q: So you say you first learned about Ebola in 2014?,"AFC: My first experience was to start an IV line for an Ebola positive patient. I was scared a bit, because I knew that if I made any mistake I would be risking my life. I was with a WHO doctor, who was helping me. I started the line, and the patient was able to take treatment. But I was really scared. I was so conscious about the openings [in my PPE]. My eyes, nose, ears, remembering that I should not touch my face. Even after working, I was scared to touch my face. After working, I went home and took a full bath. While I was working, I was living alone.  I took my children to my mother. At the end of the outbreak, I was awarded by His Excellency and his wife. I was given a medal for my work throughout the Ebola outbreak.",,,,,,Q: What was your experience as a woman working there in the Ebola Treatment Unit?,"AFC: Initially, it was taking a long time to get the test results. Some of the men that we were admitting became agitated. They would say, “Nurse, if you don’t come with my results, and you come in front of me, I will tear into the PPE that you are wearing.” So sometimes we were afraid to go inside, especially if the test hadn’t been done yet. You don’t know the result, so you are afraid, because if they tear the PPE off you, you can be infected. Sometimes you had to cajole them, talk to them, you know. We only had one lab to do the tests, so please be patient.        ","Sometimes we had to lie to them. Tell them not to worry. The results will be out soon. And they would say, “If my results do not come on time, I will go. I will come out of isolation. I will rip the door and go outside if my test results don’t come.” I would never enter the unit without a male nurse or a doctor because sometimes the patients became agitated. And you cannot restrain them because the PPE is light and they will tear it. ",,"Q: Were there any cultural barriers concerning Ebola? Cultural barriers, traditions, beliefs?","AFC: When people started dying, they said it was a witch plague. The community did not believe it was Ebola. Some people thought that we nurses were causing it, because we were giving them injections. Initially, we were stigmatized by people. But the government came in and stated, if anybody stigmatizes you an action will be taken against them. And the stigma reduced.",,,,,,,Q: How many nurses died when you were there?,"AFC: There were many nurses that died in Kenema. What I think killed most of those nurses in Kenema was taking things from the treatment center and bringing them out. And remember, you don’t have anywhere to put something. If you take something, you have to open the PPE and put it inside your clothing -- you have contact with your own physical body. ",That was the thing that killed most of the nurses in Kenema. They were bringing things out of the units. ,,,Q: Do you think anything changed in terms of practices because of Ebola?,"AFC: Yes. Before Ebola, when we had shortages of gloves, they would tell you to bring just one glove to do vitals. You would go without the other one. Since the outbreak, hand washing is more common. I’m used to it even in my house, even if I touch a small thing I go and wash my hands, because I think washing your hands can prevent many things from spreading. Because knowing or unknowing, unconscious, you will have touched something. You will touch your face. Hand-washing is the best remedy. It can help a lot.      ",,,,,,Q: Was there any impact on your personal life?,"AFC: Well, when I was working during the outbreak my fiancé left me.",,,Q: Your fiancé left you?,"AFC: Yes. He left me. He said because I was working with Ebola patients, I would come and infect him. And I said, okay, no problem. ",,,Q: You’re back together now?,"AFC: No. After the outbreak he wanted to come back. I said no, I am not interested. That time you should have stayed by me, you were not around. I don’t think I need you anymore. That was how we broke up.",,,,,"Q: For the future, if there’s a next time, what do you think should be done differently? ","AFC: If there is an outbreak, the government needs to come in right away. They did not come in early. Initially when it started, they were politicizing it. They said, oh, this is a politics thing. They were not serious about it. But I think now Sierra Leone has learned whenever there’s an outbreak, immediate action must be taken. I think health workers will not be afraid again because we have learned more. We have learned that if you protect yourself you will not be infected. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n28,Christiana Conteh,Christiana,,Conteh,Annette Mwansa Nkowane,13-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"Acting Coordinator for Infection Prevention and Control, Ministry of Health","Christiana Conteh is the acting coordinator for the Ministry of Health's Infection Prevention and Control program. Conteh is a graduate of both the National School of Nursing and the National School of Midwifery, as well as a holder of a diploma in public health. During the Ebola epidemic, she trained nurses and healthcare workers across the country about infection prevention and control.",Q: What was your role during the Ebola outbreak?,"CC: I am the acting coordinator for infection prevention and control program at the ministry of health.  I entered the Ministry of Health National School of Nursing in 1981 and I trained as a state registered nurse in 1984. Since then, I have been working in all of these hospitals, pediatric hospital, maternity, and in the general hospital. Then I did my midwifery at the National School of Midwifery in 1989 and I became a state certified midwife. I practiced for a while, then I went further to do my public health degree. I did public health in 1994, and in 1995 I earned a diploma in public health. Later, there was a dire need of anesthetists. In the whole country, we had only one doctor anesthetist, and I trained as a nurse anesthetist.  ","In 2014 I was still a nurse anesthetist when we go the call about the Ebola outbreak. I was the education officer of the Sierra Leone Health Services Workers Union. As an organization, we said, “Let us go out to educate our members.” We had the support of the ministry. We had a small taskforce that was set to come up with comprehensive plans and recommendations to the government.  We saw it was very clear that there was nothing like infection control in all of these facilities. So one of our strongest recommendations to the government was that we really wanted to see infection control in all healthcare facilities. ","And then a few weeks after, I think we had consultative meetings with WHO [World Health Organization]. Our recommendations also captured training of healthcare workers, because there was a lack of training. It was a real crisis. We had a training of the trainers on the infection control and Ebola outbreak. This was done in September 2014.  I was one of the participants.","By then, we were having more cases of Ebola. More people were dying and people were so scared. Nobody actually wanted to move forward, you know. But four of us persevered and we started training healthcare workers. We trained nurses, clinicians, and non-clinicians. We prepared them for the Ebola treatment centers, ETUs. For three months, I was donning and doffing PPE [personal protective equipment] during the training sessions because we had trainings three days each. Before that, many of our facilities were abandoned. Nurses were afraid. ","In January 2015 we had the second training. Seventy-five in total were trained, basic IPC training. And out of the seventy-five, we had IPC focal people appointed.  We were posted to different facilities. I was at Connaught Hospital, the main referral hospital, as an IPC focal, to train all the healthcare workers. In July, I was moved to the National Infection Control Unit as a training coordinator and we established the National Unit in the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. In 2018 I was actually moved to act as the national coordinator for IPC.",Q: So you mentioned there was a WHO consultant.,"CC: Yes. But during the outbreak, we had other partners. And supporting IPC was CDC [Centers for Disease Control] in Atlanta. They pushed the government so hard. CDC supported the establishment of the national unit in the ministry, in terms of office space, training, support for the unit. ",,,,,,Q: Do you remember how many you’ve trained so far?,"CC: Yes, for Ebola I trained close to six thousand healthcare workers. Six thousand healthcare workers, both clinical and nonclinical, both in Western Area and in the regions together.",,,"Q: And during your work, did you come in contact with grieving families or lost colleagues or—","CC: Not only coming into contact with grieving families. I was also grieved. I lost a brother. One of the doctors, the specialists that we lost, was a brother. And a close friend too died, the entire family got wiped out. So that gave me the zeal to actually be more committed and it added a passion in me for infection control. Because I know that with knowledge of infection control, they would not have died. The specialist, the surgeon had so much passion that even during the outbreak, he was still performing surgery. He became infected and we lost the entire family. The only surviving daughter was in Australia. The entire household died.",,,,,,,Q: How was it to deal with that loss?,"CC: I was even in Moyamba training for their ETU when she called me and asked, “Christiana, are you at home?” We live just a few meters apart from each other. I said, “No. I am—you know I’m in Moyamba. Any problem?” “Yes. I had frequent stools last night and this morning, I started vomiting.” I said, “Oh, my God. You started vomiting. Let me call so that they can pick you from the house to the facility.” She said, “No Christiana, I’ve taken the ORS [oral rehydration solution].” Then I kept calling. I kept calling but later in the day, I got the husband and the husband told me, “Oh, she’s not improving.” They took her straight to a holding center and collected a sample. As soon as the result was out in the evening, they told me she was positive. I was broken. Honestly. ","I called the husband. I called the children, you know. I had to inform the holding center. I gave the number of inhabitants in the house so they can keep monitoring them. They transferred her to the treatment center. She died before the day ended. It was not easy. I couldn’t come to her because even when you come, you cannot reach out. The moment I was planning to come, I had another call that my brother was taken to the ETU. He had a fever. Two days after, he died. It was not easy. It was really not easy. Even when you go to the burial site, you cannot pay your last respects. You are standing far away. From that moment actually, I had passion for infection control. That has actually motivated me for the past years to continue to work in this unit. ","You know what it means actually when you see colleagues die? Everybody was frightened. Nobody wants to go to the facilities. In Connaught Hospital where I was the hospital focal, we had a holding center. You come in the morning and the ambulance comes. And you see the piling corpses on top of corpses. Oh, my God. It’s like you look at yourself and say, “What am I doing here? I don’t want anything. I don’t want to be living.” But then, we have to turn around again to reassure colleagues. We have to continue working. We signed—we took a pledge yesterday to save life of humanity. So we have to go back to the wards to work. ","During the trainings, you reassure them. You give them a tap on the back. You encourage them to follow the standards, to work safely, so that we can break the chain of transmission. during the Ebola outbreak here, we saw clearly there were lapses in infection control. We had no control over resources. We had limited supplies. You have to look at the whole system, the supplies. You also have to back it up with trainings because people have to be knowledgeable enough for them to follow the rules and guidelines. And then of course, you have to do regular monitoring. That is what we are doing now as a national unit. We’re making sure we’re doing trainings. We are monitoring the facilities, supervision, mentorship, encouraging healthcare workers so that we can actually minimize the spread of infection within the healthcare setting.","Q: What about the impact on women? In the nursing profession, where there are more women, and also in the community, how did it play out in this?","CC: Women carry all the burden when someone is sick. It’s the women. It’s the mother, the wife, the daughters. They’re the ones who give care, who provide the care at home. So when you actually look into the infection rate during the outbreak, more women were infected than men. They are mothers. They have to take care of the babies. They have to take care of the family. As nurses, it was not actually easy for us because when these patients do come, we give care. You see a little girl. A patient is admitted. You really want to go closer to call to that child, reassure that patient. As a result, a lot of healthcare workers were infected. It was no secret. We are hands-on. We are caring for patients hands-on with limited resources. We don’t have sophisticated equipment. So lack of the knowledge and passion for the job actually led to the high infection rates among the healthcare workers.","One of the challenges we actually faced, when we started pushing for infection control, we had a lot of doctors pushing away from us. They said, “What can the nurses know? A nurse cannot teach me. I am more educated than these nurses. Why should they come and teach me?” But then they actually saw the impact we created. Gradually, we had to win them over. And they started coming for the trainings. Some men don’t actually believe that a woman can lead, can be a boss, that a woman knows anything more than me as a man. So that was one of the confrontations. ","Gradually with the implementation of the measures in their facilities, they came to realize that, you know what, we have to reckon with these nurses, because the nurses are with the patient twenty-four/seven and they are hands-on. A doctor can come to the unit. The doctor can never touch except they touch the notes. But the nurses are hands-on. They started listening to nurses. And, you know, a nurse can actually come and say, “Doctor, I want you to work safe.” “Doctor, you have to perform hand hygiene. You have to wash your hands.” ","Also as a mother at home, during my involvement in the outbreak, it was not easy for me. I had to push away my children. I told them I don’t want that bonding for as long as I am in the facilities. I had my own corner, I had my room. We can talk but we are not actually close together. ","And I told them, if I am to be infected, let me be infected alone. I don’t want infection to spread. I don’t want you to die. If I am going to die, let me die alone and you will live to tell the story. So in the morning when I’m leaving for work, you know, I have my grandchildren at home. My daughter, my son, they are all there. And everybody will just keep away, “Goodbye, mom. Good luck.” I say, “Good luck. I’m coming back.” When they hear my voice, you know, everybody rushed towards the door and they said, “Oh, mommy. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, grandma, how are you?” And they will have to move back. Even my husband had to move from the bedroom. [laughs] He had to move to another room. So I was virtually alone for 2014 and 2015. Until ‘15, yes, 2015. Life was now a bit different. And we actually started working together again. The bonding, we started bonding again together. But it was rather unfortunate. At that time, a month after, my husband died. He died.",,Q: He died of Ebola?,"CC: No, no. He didn’t die of Ebola but we were still having the safe burial protocols, that every funeral, every burial—the burial team has to bury that corpse. My father died was a very old man, 106 years. He was very old. But they had to put him in the body bag. And I saw the burial team taking my father, whom I knew was not infected, because their own location, their village, there was no Ebola outbreak in their own surroundings actually, immediately. So there was no infection of Ebola there, but that was the national protocol.  I looked at them. They put my father in a body bag. I couldn’t even get closer to my father. I had to walk a distance away from the ambulance until they got to the cemetery. But yet I said, “No, I am a nurse and I am going to continue to be in this. I will stay away.” So that is the passion I have for infection control.",,,Q:  You are doing so much with infection control. What do you think is the general outlook among health workers and the communities since Ebola has been coming down? Do you think things have changed?,"CC: Habit, behavior, is something that is very difficult to win over. We’re having a major challenge amongst healthcare workers, the behavioral change. It is very clear that hand hygiene alone can actually remove up to eighty to ninety percent of microorganisms. But to get healthcare workers to comply with hand hygiene is a big challenge. It’s also constant monitoring. You have to monitor constantly, use mentorship and on-the-job trainings. ","Amongst the community, we had a lot of negative feedback. When you tell them to wash their hands, they tell you, “If I wash my hands, do you have food to give me?” A whole lot of people dropped hand hygiene despite ongoing sensitization, health education, and community engagement. We still have to work at it to win them over. There are also still people in our community who don’t believe in going to a healthcare facility. They go to the traditional healers. How can we change that one? It’s a bit difficult because that’s their belief. They will tell you it’s not a “hospital sickness.” But by and large, we are really pushing. We are trying. You know, our country, every year we have had a cholera outbreak. But since the Ebola outbreak, when there was this consciousness of handwashing, this has improved. Since 2014, we have not had a cholera outbreak in Sierra Leone.",,Q: Thank you so much. Is there anything you want to add before I close out our discussion?,"CC: I want to say that nurses have been instrumental and have been the pivot of our success today and during the outbreak in 2014-2015. Nurses have worked hard and under difficult conditions. But yet, there is still commitment from the nurses, the healthcare workers. They are committed to save lives, even with the limited resources that we have. There are things to change but because nurses don’t have the opportunities, don’t have the capabilities, that’s the frustrations that nurses have. You want things to happen but you are not in authority to make sure it happens. So that’s the frustration that nurses actually have. Nurses have been instrumental and we’ve kept our promise, our pledge to save the lives of our people in this part of the country. So that’s our commitment and we stand and we continue to do that. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the Ebola epidemic, Koroma was working at Princess Christian Maternity Hospital, treating patients and training other nurses and healthcare workers. She currently works as a charge nurse in the Critical Care Unit at Connaught Teaching Hospital.",,"EK: I’m a state registered nurse and later trained as a critical care nurse in Korle-Bu, Ghana. And when I returned, I returned to the ER [emergency room]. Then we had the outbreak of Ebola.",,,,,Q: I’m happy to know that you’re a nurse with an area of specialization in critical care. Why did you decide to become a nurse?,"EK: The passion was there since I was a child because my mother worked as a nurse’s aide at a mental hospital. I saw how people were struggling, and there wasn’t much that could be done to save them. When I grew up, I wanted to be part of those saving lives and giving people a better future. Now, I am a charge nurse at the critical care unit in Connaught Hospital.",,,,,,"Q: When the Ebola started, you were still working at Connaught?","EK: No, I was working at the PCMH [Princess Christian Maternity Hospital].",,,"Q: When the Ebola started, how did you get to know about it?","EK: From a radio program and information from the Ministry of Health. We were called upon to be trained in infection prevention conducted by our chief nursing and medical officer. We did a training for three days. Then, we were sent out to our different areas. We had our first case around July 2014.",,,,,,,Q: What was your exact role during that time?,"EK: My role was to mentor some of the nurses. I was the charge nurse keeping records and taking all vital statistics. I also used to go in and do deliveries, treatment, feeding of patients, and all. The nurses would do the normal nursing procedures, recording their vitals in the morning. Normally, I worked in the morning and up to 4:00, 5:00 in the evening. I encouraged the nurses so that they would continue to keep monitoring the patient. But when Partners [in] Health came, they were very, very helpful and they encouraged us. With the intervention of Partners in Health, we started giving IV infusions, and many of these patients now, they are being saved and rescued from death. ",,,,Q: Do you think more mothers died during that time than maybe during the other times when Ebola was not there?,"EK: Yes, more mothers died that time. More mothers died because of fear. Like a lady would deliver somewhere outside, and she came because of profuse bleeding, and we have to give her a transfusion and the rest of it. Other nurses—even some of the doctors, “Why do we want to give them blood? They are bleeding. And let us wait for the results.” But by the time we wait now for the Ebola results, they’ve passed away because of the bleeding. So later on, everything we gave transfusions. ",,,,,,Q: So how did you manage to make sure that the nurses or the team members were available twenty-four hours as long as the patients were there?,"EK:  We worked on paid shifts. We start at 8:00 in the morning and we end around 2:30, 3:00. Then, the other ones take over, and they end over around 8:00 to 9:00. Then, the night shifts run from around 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 in the morning. It was three shifts, and we would do the handing over and taking over correctly. Whatever is being handled, we will be informed, and whatever is coming, we will be informed. And for their own supply, for the night partners, we built a store outside and a store inside. I leave everything they need. I will say this is for the day shift, and this is for the night shift. Whatever is left, of course, we will give them more than enough. Because at times, we don’t know—the workload or the number of cases that will come so we give them extra. ",,,"Q: From what you went through, what do you think were some of the reasons why the epidemic spread so fast and killed a lot of our colleagues and families?","EK: Let me say it was out of ignorance and basic knowledge concerning Infection Prevention Control. Because most of us, even in the nursing field at that time, were not too aware. Using gloves was maybe only for those doing deliveries. Then, it spread again because of fear. Many people were afraid and they were just doing things on their own. They would run from one point—when they have an attack, they leave their own family, go and stay with another family. Maybe that family had already been infected. We had somebody living not too far from PCMH Hospital, a boy, a youth. The mother died. One of the sisters died before they realized it was Ebola. He just sneaked away from home and went to the other relatives and he had already been infected. He started feeling sick there. Most of the family died because of Ebola and denial. Denial. They will say that it is not Ebola, it is not Ebola. That was the reason.",,,Q: Do you think your government was prepared?,"EK: The government was not prepared for an outbreak like that. Because at the initial stage, you know in Freetown here, the disease came in gradually. And there was denial. Some would leave their own provinces and come down to Freetown here. There was no protective clothing, and even the nurses were not too knowledgeable about handling those cases well. The government was really not prepared. It took them some time to get a response to the disease. That was why it also spread.",,,,,"Q: So if we had to do it again, or if it had to happen again, or any epidemic, how prepared are you? Or how prepared do you think is our country to manage the crisis?","EK: I think they should have a command center in place. Because even now, they are doing their continuous monitoring and teaching people. We have to fight for the way I use my gloves. Because even now, there aren’t enough gloves for us. We aren’t using that full PPE anymore. We’re almost going back to where we came from. ",,"Q: No, let’s hope for the best. And especially since the trainings are still continuing. ","EK: They are continuing and continue monitoring. And in every ward now, we have an IPC focused infection prevention person that is watching. And we continue to do our hand-wash regularly at the station there. Even those without tap, we are using the bucket. That’s one good thing. We are keeping it just in case [laughs].",,,,"Q: That’s very good. What is maybe one thing too that you remember most that was really touching during the Ebola experience that you had, that you’d want the nurses in Sierra Leone to know and beyond like us and—","EK: Well, you shouldn’t judge everyone, and maybe some are weak. They can’t stand certain crises. Some are strong. I was strong, because all the nurses were running away from me. And even one of our doctors. After I left his office, he removed everything and had the cleaners come and scrub everywhere. Then he sent me a message saying that I shouldn’t go into his office at any time. Let that be the last time I’m going into that office.",,,,Q: He told you that?,"EK: Yes, I was really disturbed by that, but I knew that’s just because of fear. That’s why he treated me that way. When the supplies are coming, the head of the hospital wanted to handle everything, but he’s so afraid that he doesn’t even want to see these patients. He will run scared, but when the good things are coming, he wants to do everything. He wants to be in charge. That is where we are having misunderstandings. Because what the patients are entitled to, and even the nurses who are taking the risk, the doctors want also to benefit. That was [laughs] my other experience. I believe when you are well protected, and you take your necessary precaution, you will be free from this. ",,,Q: Has the experience changed you or made you stronger?,"EK: Yes, it made me stronger and made me believe and trust God more. Because that was my daily commitment to God, saying, “Lord, I’m doing this because you called me to do it. And I will not die. And we also [phonetic] declare your goodness, and we do this for Him.” There was a Scripture I was reading at that time, the Samson story.  Samson died with his enemy. He was able to achieve much, but he died with his enemy, and I told God that I should not die with my enemy. Ebola is my enemy. I shouldn’t die with him. I will fight until the very end. And I was fortunate. [laughs]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the Ebola epidemic, Samura was the acting matron at Police Training School 1 Ebola Treatment Center in Hastings, Freetown. In addition to treating patients, Samura worked on community administrative programs during the epidemic.",Q: What made you decide to become a nurse? ,"FS:  I want to take care of the sick. My mother was a midwife—state-certified midwife—so, at times when she tried to take care of patients, I grew closer to her. I like the nursing profession.",,,,,"Q: Since you joined nursing, what role have you been playing? ",FS: I an active matron during the Ebola at PTS1 [Ebola Treatment Unit PTS1]. I also went to the treatment ward to take care of patients—together with the doctor.,,,,,,"Q: When you first heard about the Ebola, did you have any idea about what that could mean? And then, did you understand what the disease was all about?",,"FS: I knew that Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever disease. You can’t get contact with fluid, or even body contact. You can’t be in contact with someone that is positive. You will be infected, obviously. You can’t sleep in the same apartment with the person, share things in common—no, it should not be done. You will be infected.",,"Q: So, when the government declared that we had that problem, how were you engaged?","FS:  When we were called by the then CNO [Chief Nursing Officer]—this is Hosinatu Koroma-- that we should go for training at the Siaka Stevens Stadium I told my husband, I wanted to go. He said, “No.” I said, “No, I’m here to serve humanity. So, I just have to.”  He said, “OK, you can go ahead, but I’m going to leave you here. I’m going to work in the provinces.” I said, “No problem.” So, we went for the training for three days, then the fourth day we were taken to Hastings and we started to work immediately. I was committed to the job, because I was acting in the place of a staff nurse, SRN. ","They appointed me as the acting matron and I was second to the Ministry. The then CNO approved, so I started working in the capacity of a matron. But notwithstanding the fact that I was a matron, I always went into the treatment center, to give IV fluids to patients. ",,,,,,"Q: When you were summoned by the Chief Nursing Officer for a three-day training, what were you trained on? ","FS: The precautions, how to wear the PPE—the protective attire, that we should not ever make any attempt to treat someone at home when the person is sick. We should report to the emergency line, so that the person should be taken to the treatment center. We should work in the treatment center according to the rules and guidelines of the treatment center how to remove the PPE. We should do that correctly, then after treatment, we should wash ourselves—take care of the body, change the clothing, only then do we go home. We should not get in contact with anybody that is sick. ",,,,Q: How many other nurses did you have?,"FS:  About 225 nurses, the hygienists, the doctors and Dr. Cecil, was the coordinator.",,,,,,"Q: So, what exactly was your specific role as a matron then?","FS: I was doing administrative work, then I was even going into the ",treatment center to assist doctors to treat the patients.,,Q: You were going there yourself?,"FS: Yes, I was doing monitoring for the food stuff of the patients and the kitchen. In the morning I would make preparations for food for the patients, see that they have their breakfast—because they would have four meals a day. Breakfast they had by eleven, then midday, at night is their dinner—I would go and make sure everything is okay there, then I would put on my PPE, and go into the treatment center. I would ask patients, “What is your problem? What do you need?” Maybe they need toiletries, maybe they will need to change their clothes, or change the bed linen—because all those things, when they use it once, we throw it away. We put them into the body pits. We don’t allow them to use underwear, or any linen twice.  I ask them to take off their things—they go and take their bath, then I pack them according to their request. I ask one or two nurses to go with me and we change the linen. We ask whether they need pepper soup, or what?” If they said yes, we would immediately request this soup. Mango. We prepare it for them like goat soup.",,,"Q: That’s good. So, other patients that you had there. Were they already positive, or some of them?",FS: Positive. All the cases we had were positive cases.,,,,,"Q: So, how were you protecting yourselves to make sure that you were not infected?","FS: I was protecting myself very well, because even if they say to wear two gloves, I will wear three [laughs]. And we never reuse any gloves, and we never treat any patient at home. I make sure when I want to go into the treatment center I will dress properly. When we set up the IV, I make sure not to recap the needle, because that was what was giving many nurses problems. When we peel off the plasters I make sure I peel them off and put them on a strip before going to the treatment center. Because if you make attempt to peel it inside the treatment center, it will pierce the glove. Then obviously fluid will enter. You will be infected. ",,"Q: So, in terms of ward management and management of the patients that you had, what were the roles of the doctors and other professional colleagues?","FS: They go in every two hours but most times during the ward setting, there is always a nurse present. When there is a problem they will call, “Matron, this patient—something is wrong with this patient.” The nurse will actually explain what is happening to the patient, so the doctor will prepare the drugs and go in. We call for all the nurses to go with him in, and go in. We don’t leave the patients in the treatment center without any medical staff in. We always make sure there is someone—after the forty-five minute span, they come out, they change and someone else will go in. They will be going around to monitor the patients in the various wards.",,,,"Q: So, at no point in time was the patient left alone.","FS: We don’t leave them alone. There are medical staff there always working. If not, you will see the hygienists cleaning, because they clean twenty-four hours, because we don’t want vomit, also any other feces to be in the ward. It will upset the other patients. So, they make sure it is clean. We even have a ward here that we call the “Critical Ward.” When you have some patients that are helpless, there is always a doctor there. ",,,,"Q: If we think back about this situation now, what is it that you think that maybe we needed? If they were there for the outbreak, maybe things could have been controlled better.","FS: Make sure that we have enough medications, enough staff. Then, if we get any news—God forbid, we are not pulling for that—if we have any news there is a breakout here of Ebola, we just quarantine the whole village and open a treatment center there while we tackle the disease. It can’t go out. It can’t spread.",,,"Q: But when it just started, what was the reaction of the communities itself? ","FS: When the Ebola disease started, people were denying, saying, it’s a lie. “We don’t have such diseases.” For some that are educated, you need to advise them on preventative measures that you should take—not to take care of someone that is sick, not to loan clothes out to people like that. ",,"Q: What were some of the things that you think you did very well, during the Ebola outbreak? You personally, and also the colleagues that you used to work with.","FS: I always advised them “Don’t treat patients at home, even if it’s your husband or your child. Bring them to the center. We’ll know what to do.” ",,Q: For some of the patients that you managed or some of the people that you discharged—are you still in touch with them today?,"FS: Of course, of course. Many of them. When they are discharged I have to take them with a bus—I take them to the community people, I talk to them. One time I went to buy fish, and I’d forgotten the guy. And he started shouting——“Oh, Matron, Matron, Matron.” I said, “Who is calling me?” Well, immediately I heard “Matron,” I knew that this is someone that knows me. I did not pay for that fish. He says, “Matron, every time you come here, just look for me, and here I will give you fish.” I am ashamed now to go there, for him to be giving me fish all the time. ",,,"Q: So, what message do you have to fellow nurses out there—not just in Sierra Leone—about how we should be ready to respond and help as you have just explained?","FS: They should be committed to the job. Even if they say there is an Ebola outbreak here, don’t run away. Tell your family “I’m going to serve the community.” Don’t treat patients at home. Make sure you put on your PPE the correct way, and remove it the correct way. Don’t take drugs from the treatment center to your house to treat patients. Anything that concerns the treatment center, don’t take it home. It is not nice. Just commit yourself to the job. Say, “God, I’m working for humanity, save me.” Obviously, you will be protected.",,,"Q: I’m really encouraged and impressed with the level of dedication, and I really like the aspect of saving humanity. Because true, money will never be enough to pay us. I just hope that the awareness sessions are still going out, you know, being taught to the communities about how we can prevent the infections—not just today, but also in the future. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the Ebola epidemic, many members of Kargbo's immediate family contracted and were lost to Ebola. He credits his survival to his colleagues. He is now a nurse at Ola During Children's Hospital in Freetown and works to raise awareness and decrease stigma for Ebola survivors.",Q: Can you tell me what you do as a nurse? ,FK: I’m a nurse by profession. I started as a nursing student and a community health [phonetic] nurse. I went as far as a state registered nurse. I am now a student nurse for the BS [Bachelor of Science] in Nursing.,,,,,Q: When did you decide growing up that you needed to be a nurse?,"FK: I trained as a teacher first. But I believe that nursing is a calling, because I was trained as a teacher, and started teaching, but then something happened with me that led me to go into nursing. I’m very proud to be a nurse.",,,,,,Q: Okay. When did you first hear about Ebola? Remember the first time you ever even heard the word Ebola? And who was the first case? Was it a man? A woman? Do you remember the circumstances about that case?,"FK: We understood that someone from Guinea entered around the eastern part of Sierra Leone, where he began to manifest some signs and symptoms. I don’t know the date. The thing began to spread, because the person started manifesting some signs and symptoms at the end of day. It began to spread around the eastern part of Sierra Leone. But, funnily, what really happened, since we have little idea about epidemiology, they tried to find the way forward, at least to quarantine those areas. We never had had that experience of the disease. They politicized things because this government, anything that comes, they just want to punish those people at that particular part of the country. So politics came, and it’s politics that made us suffer.","I suffered so much, because when the thing came, my wife was also a nurse, a trained nurse, and she was working at Rokupa Government Hospital. A man, Dr. Sepik Omar, treated somebody who has got Ebola, and later the person died. This news was made known to certain people in the hospital, but my wife and the others never knew about this. The man was brought to the hospital, and he was admitted the same ward my wife was in.",,"Q: As she was giving care, where she was working as a nurse?","FK: Everybody was paying attention to him, including my wife. And when Dr. Charlie [phonetic] really examined that patient, he suspected Ebola, while the other members of the medical team were saying it wasn’t. In fact, they said the doctor has stigmatized this man. At the end of the day everybody has to come around him, touching him, and even when he died, my wife and others did the last office. My wife and the others, they all died as a result of this one, Dr. Sepik Omar [phonetic].",,,,,,,Q: And he was a doctor? A nurse?,"FK: No, he was the pharmacist. He was the pharmacist, but at his pharmacy they treat people at home. The unfortunate part of it was that the hospital never called the health workers who cared for this man for them to be quarantined, including my wife. My wife began manifesting all the signs and symptoms. And she died 11 September. In fact, when she was manifesting the signs, she was at home with me. My children, too, we were all caring for her. When she vomited, we helped her empty the things, and other thing. So my elder daughter, my other daughter, my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law, my mother, my brother, they all died as a result of this condition. We were taken at Chinese [phonetic] Hospital and later to the holding center, where they all died. I was the only person that was able to survive out of it. So I am not only as a nurse, to tell the story; I am what—I suffered the pain, you know. You see? I suffered the pain. This is the certificate of my wife, who died, and this is my discharge certificate. The only person that was really helping me, was the registrar.",,,,Q: Yes. She told me about calling you every day.,"FK: She really played a part. She acted as a mother [phonetic] to me. She was checking me day in/day out, calling me. She helped me. And then after I was discharged, I faced a lot of stigmatization. Even at the faculty—by then I was doing my RN—nobody would come close to me, and when I went to pray nobody. Even my colleagues were moving away from me. I was really embarrassed. And then after some time I joined the holding center at [unclear] Hospital. I was trying to help to save other people. If there is anything to be done, we, the people that suffered this, and the nurses—there are nurses, well, they never survived. I survived. I went through it. I know how it happens, unlike the others, who’d only heard it. I’m working again on the response team.",,,,,,"Q: So— [pause] I’m just praying for you. [pause] Fonti, when you—","FK: Sometimes when we are called upon to these interviews, we don’t want to face that, because you can just face a lot of embarrassment, talk about the old things. But I think God is having a purpose [phonetic]. That’s why I’m pushing myself now, at least to serve best I can. I began to join other holding centers, taking care of people. We are donating blood for others. We come and they collect our blood. We did a lot of hard things. But because of the stigma sometimes I don’t want to talk about it, because when you talk about it they’re supposed to help us to learn, but you can’t teach others about, because we get the life story. ","We don’t only work, but we went through the systems, and we were really affected.  As the saying goes, who feels it, knows it better.",,"Q: And we only— We often don’t understand why us, and why—I was going to say the path of Allah, path of whoever we give worship to, why us, and why would this be my journey to go on. You must have a lot of higher powers that are really guiding you to be who you are today. What would you want to be different if we had another outbreak? What would you say for nurses we should do differently? Just not as nurses, but as nursing leaders. How do we change things? How are our voices heard differently?","FK: Capacity-building is very, very important. And people should be able, at least, to change the attitude of—particularly with the health workers. We don’t do most of the hand hygiene. The education about Ebola stopped long ago, and that’s supposed to continue. People must learn about it, and even this IPC [infection prevention and control] is supposed to be incorporated into the curriculum, people should not only learn about it but to put it into practice. ","What are they doing? Do we have at least a blood bank? That is not happening. If you know that this person has immunity, there is something that you have to do with regards to blood use. Scientifically, they know what to do. Well, all those things are not in place. We are just following the money, money, money. The right things are not being done. ","That’s why I really want to-—if I finish my program, I really want to go into this epidemiology, because if you are going to do something you must be part of the team to see how best this will not come back to this country. That is my dream. ","Q: Do you think that communities have changed about Ebola now? So I know there was a lot of fear, there was a lot of stigma. Do you think people are generally more educated because of it now, to face other epidemics? In terms of awareness, in terms of fear, or not touching, or things that have no scientific basis, right? They’re people acting out of fear or ignorance.","FK:  Well, to me, initially when we had the epidemic, I can see that there was awareness. But for now, people have forgotten.",,,,,Q: So quickly.,"FK: People have forgotten about it. Now you people have come from afar, say you are interested in this. You know what it means. You know the effect of Ebola. That’s why you are still on it [phonetic]. But for us, we have forgotten. We don’t care. We don’t even know what has happened. Only for those of us that suffer the pain knows. Well, then they can sit and laugh. Try to not laugh, because I have over seven people [in my family] that have died of Ebola, and I also went through it. Today, I’m a single parent to my daughter, you see? But the others that were just fortunate to be part of the system, they were paid for their service, they never lose, so they can easily forget.",,"Q: Our responsibility is that no one forgets, right?",FK: Yes.,Q: And you certainly are a leader in making sure we don’t forget. ,"FK: Even though any time I have to talk about this it pains me, it makes me remember what I have lost, but all the same I should not be so selfish enough to keep it. I must say it to people so that—tell other people so that what I have survived, other people will not suffer that again. And that is my aim. I’m always ready, available, at your disposal, any time you call me on the phone, for any program related to Ebola, I’m ready at least to give my time and my support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n32,Haurace Nyandemoh,Haurace,,Nyandemoh,Margaret Loma Phiri,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,"MPA Candidate, Public Health","Haurace Nyandemoh is a state-registered nurse who holds a BSc in nursing. At the start of the Ebola epidemic, he was among the first group of volunteers trained by the WHO in Kenema to staff the holding center there. In addition to treating Ebola patients, he conducted PPE and treatment trainings as well as organizing the ward's staffing. He is currently pursuing his masters in public health.",Q: We are here to hear your story about exactly what happened during the Ebola epidemic. What is your background? ,"HN: I’m a nurse. I’m a SCCHM, what we call a certificate in nursing. I did my SRN [State Registered Nurse], which is an RN [Registered Nurse] diploma. I did my BS [Bachelor of Science] in nursing. I’m now doing an MPA, master’s in public health.",,,,,Q: What made you become a nurse? Do you like it?,"HN: It’s a passion. In terms of care, my mom was not really a nurse, but she was a nurse at home. I saw all what she was going through. I decided that’s a good passion, for nursing, not going into another field, the commercial world, be a banker, make fast money. But I want to serve humanity. That’s really what made me to go into nursing, serving humanity.",,,,,,"Q: When Ebola happened and when it was confirmed again on the 24 of May, 2014, how did you get engaged in it?","HN: We were the first volunteers to be trained by the WHO [World Health Organization], intensive training for two weeks. We had the first treatment center open at Hastings; I was deployed there, and I was in charge of nineteen nurses but only three or four stood the test of time.",,,Q: What were you trained in? What was the training about?,"HN: The training was all about handling of EVD [phonetic] patients. There was no treatment regimen. What they told us is that if the person is having diarrhea or vomiting, you give that person ORS, oral rehydration salts. Because you have to replenish the hydration, definitely. And Paracetamol. Those were the only treatments we had at first.",,,,,,,"Q: So, what exactly were your roles? What were you doing, the nurses who were there?","HN: I was the charge nurse, not only in nursing percent of the ward. I was doing training, relocating nurses by ward. Definitely you don’t go in [one] by one, you go in by pairs, because mistakes may happen. When gowning, when you are removing your PPE, your next best colleague would be there watching you for any mistakes done. I was making sure that the place was really running smooth. That was Hastings 1 which was PTS1 [PTS1 Ebola Treatment Center, Hastings, Freetown, Sierra Leone] ",,,,Q: It was PTS1?,"HN: PTS1. But then it was PTS, Police Training School Treatment Center, only. ",,,,,,"Q: So, when the cases started arriving in numbers, how did you manage it?","HN: It was not easy. The first point of contact was triage, female wards, male wards. All we were giving, as I said before, was treating for the fever, and also the dehydration, and give them food. Their family foods were coming in. So, they have their three days meals, in the morning they have tea. ","In a week or two weeks, I wasn’t doing the tracking, I was like a PR Officer for the center. We admitted over a hundred cases and, trust me, over sixty percent of those cases died. Yes, I can still remember. Over sixty percent of those cases passed out, they passed out. But I had a very strong team at that time, and we are a team with the military. I said, “You know what? It’s not in our protocol to treat. But let’s go back to the blackboard and see how we can change some things.” Because these people were coming in with EVD. But if you can treat the underlying causes, you can really sustain a level of this person. We got all the drugs we needed, anti-malaria, antibiotics. We need to start having survivors. And that’s how we were able to have survivors.",,"Q: So, as the one in charge, how were you mobilizing your people?","HN: If the workers are seeing you working, definitely they will follow your footsteps. If I sit behind giving orders, they will never. So, I make sure that we go in together. We do what we have to do together. ","I can still remember I had the first fever. [laughs] Working in the treatment center, not a holding center, my temperature shoots up. I called my doctor in charge at that time, Dr. Satalikas [phonetic]. I say, “Doc, I think I have it.” He said, “No, you don’t.” I said, “Doc, no, I’m serious.” He said, “No, you don’t. Go into your billet.” Because they gave us an area to rest, when you are tired, you have to go and rest. That was the whole treatment, no tests done. No anti-malaria, antibiotics overdose. I went home, fever. My son went to come closer to me, I told my wife, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don’t even touch me, please.” I was shivering. I did not sleep on the bed.” I slept on the floor. Waking up in the morning, I had to go to the hospital, but all my blankets, have to put it in water, give it enough chlorine, and I went home. I went again to work. Because I don’t want people saying, if we have any fever, automatically - the logic was, as long as you’re a healthcare worker, you’re working a treatment center, the chances of you having it was great. That’s the thinking. And the case definition is temperature high up. And have the other signs to look for, and also, where are you coming from? So knowing that, for example, with my son, having a  high fever. The father is working in a treatment center. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Push this boy away. Automatically, he had gotten it from the father. Even if it is negative and said, no, let us still observe. ",,"Q: So, did the fever subside?","HN: Definitely. By antimalarials, by antibiotics. [laughs] It subsided, it subsided.",,,,,"Q: What were the things that you learned from this experience? Things that you’d want us to remember and to continue with them, and things that would you would also want to remember that we wished we had done them better. What were some of the successes?","HN: Yes, we had successes, yes. For Sierra Leone, if my memory serves me well we had about 8,704 infected victim positive cases.",,Q: Eight thousand?,"HN: 704. Of that 8,704, 3,589 passed away. 3,589 passed away. We had our first case on the 24 of May, 2014, and the WHO declared Ebola really over in Sierra Leone on the 7 of November, 2015. Some of us were saying after the outbreak, Sierra Leone is not the first country to have Ebola. Congo had it, and Ebola came from the name of the river in Congo. But people didn’t have much idea about how the virus can mutate. The information given at first sight was the previous information based on what they saw happen in Congo. So, some of the lessons learned is about communication during outbreaks. We were not prepared for outbreaks to occur. The first people you should take into consideration before it spreads are the community members. ","Some of the lessons learned were that our problems or our mistakes that we made were because the message was not well filtered-down. And, because it was not well filtered-down, then here we’ve got that higher probability [of the virus spreading]. Never mind that it was our first experience. Then, the training geared, the first training was really telling  about the “no touch” procedure, but we don’t teach signs and symptoms. But, in person, we got better by using our own immune system, fighting the virus.",,,"Q: So, if it happens again, for example, or any type of epidemic, what advice would you have, for example for the government, in terms of preparedness? What should we be having in place to effectively manage? ","HN: The structures should be well equipped. It’s only through the outbreak we even knew what is IPC [infection prevention and control], washing of hands. And even right now, as I’m talking to you, they don’t even always use these gloves. So, they only obey [procedures] during the Ebola outbreak. I can work in the ward, and they are giving you a limited supply of gloves. So, when I say structure, I’m talking about resources in total. We have young brains here that you can send to some courses, they come back and be well prepared for any emergency coming up. Two weeks, even in one training on EVD [phonetic] is not enough for you to work in a treatment center. ","But we did it out of humanity, because we wanted to fight. Some of these things are the things that the government should put in place. And also recognizing the work that people did. Some of us, we worked throughout, like my other brother told me, “Haurace, why are you working?” I said, “You can feed me, but you cannot feed me forever. I have my own family to take care of. You expect me to sit at home begging you?” No. ","I want my voice to be heard; I want to be recognized that I was one of the fighters. But these medals were not given to people like us, like nurses, never. But people were given medals that didn’t even touch an Ebola patient. I’m talking from the general perspective here. People got called on state television, given medals that never went into a treatment center.  What about those that died at the treatment center. How are you encouraging them also? So, I say it’s not enough. They will be using us like guinea pigs working for them. ","HN: When you promise people, when you promise people, do something about it. The thing is some of them died. We lost 221, that’s what the record had that we had lost. 221, in fact, we lost over 500. ",Q: That’s what you think?,"HN: As I already said, I got into medicine because I love nursing. They recognize the eleven doctors that we lost in this country, but they don’t recognize how many nurses we lost in this country. ",,,Q: They didn’t?,HN: None. You can go and Google how many doctors lost. But type how many nurses and see if there’s how many? ,,Q: How many doctors did we lose?,"HN: In total, we lost something like eleven, counting the bodies. Eleven or ten, because we only had one survivor, who I was also working with, who is Dr. Samubria [phonetic]. I worked with him until he got the infection. We did the discharge together. So, when they told me that he is infected, I say, “Well, he’s a doctor. If he was infected, I’m infected, too.” In a sense being that, again, the laboratories, not only having the lab doing this. But some of the lab results are mistakes. A lot of people died, but not [because of] Ebola.",,Q: It was something different?,"HN: The results came out positive. But a lot of people really had different symptoms, like I said. Being a witness I cannot say anything much. I have a case, it’s just a case, I have a case. The test results waited for the patient, I saw the test results waiting for the patient, came positive. I said, “No. This person doesn’t look like somebody who’s positive. Never mind there is fever. Let’s treat with antibiotics and give our first line treatment. We sent out, I know, five different specimens from the same individual, with five different names from that same individual. ","After two weeks of treatment, we sent five specimens from the same individual, five different names. Three came negative, two came positive. So, how can you interpret that? I was expecting maybe three negative, the other two should be negative, but when it was two positive, the other three should be positive. So having two results. So, if in the case of the doctor I told you, my doctor, Dr. Martin Salia, his whole house was quarantined. Even the person that was a caretaker that was closer to him who is his body. She never got the infection. But she was the one giving him the treatment when he put him in the billet. Was taking care of him doing everything for him. But our result was negative. But they said, “Doctor, it’s a virus.” And the second result was positive. And the quarantine house, she’s my colleague. Up today she’s there, she’s never positive. ","Some of these things, the explanation, the tests, these other things. It’s different. Sometimes we can see the patients. We have some cases, people go and give them HIV positive, go to other places, they say they are HIV negative. Yes, I’ve seen it. And what will we say to the patients?  Oh the reagent. That’s just what you put up, blame cast on. But let’s look at the beyond, not jumping into conclusions. The message to pass on, and what people are seeing, is two different things. ","Q: But, you see, what I’m learning from this, Haurace, is the critical role of a nurse, as the people who really know about the patient. We are not saying other health workers have a minor role to play. But the fact that you were there twenty-four hours, doing all these things, and the example that you have just given about the differences. And some of the initiatives that you studied, and treatments, I think maybe some of these interviews are really key for people to know that we really have a critical role to play in the delivery of healthcare services.","HN: I hope that. At our center, like I say again, we are nurses in outside life. But again, it’s our system. We are going to need a change. They did a whole documentary of Hastings Ebola treatment center, after doing our third discharge, which was--at that time--our highest discharge which was just for two patients. They showed the nurses that fought Ebola. Nurses like us, you can’t believe. All, of course, we are there. I saw other colleagues, the nurses were not there. I saw the doctors and others maybe. So, do you know how you feel sometimes? Why did I really do nursing? But again, I always sit down and said, “I have something in me that I want to portray.” ","A single individual can change a system, if only you stand firm to change the system. That’s what I always say. I’m telling you on the front point, not because I want an interview, trust me. I served, but our problem we have here is some careers in government are not respected, trust me. Nurses, we know the patient more than all over health care professionals. Nurses, we are with the patients twenty-four seven. ","So, one doctor, he called me only once, I said, “I’m here to see—.” And then it’s maybe it’s two, three days before that doctor comes back. That nurse can only go to the pharmacist when he or she is discharged and wants to buy medicine. But the nurses goes there to buy drugs. So you have to give you prescriptions, or the patient’s relative goes and buys from the pharmacist. That nurse can only go to the lab technician or the phlebotomist, when that lab technician had to come and take samples. But you are the nurse, you are there twenty-four seven. But I say, “Have you taken your medicine? Okay, please take two. Look at these, take a glass of water.” You are doing bedside, you are with a patient, but your role is not respected. It’s pathetic, really. We just pray that with your assistance, that things will change. That’s all we are praying for. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am the Chief Nursing Officer, currently on leave. ",,,,,Q: What was your specific position of employment during the Ebola outbreak?,HMK: I was the Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer.,,,,,,Q: Can you tell me a bit about when did ever first hear of Ebola Viral Disease?,"HMK:  I heard of Ebola Viral two years before we had the outbreak, but this was in Congo. Thinking of Congo as the central part of Africa, we never thought we would have that, nor did we know that because people were migrating, and that because it’s a disease of contact, and for as long as one is infected and moving from one area to another, there’s a possibility that the infection would spread. I never thought we were going to have Ebola in Sierra Leone.",,,Q: And when did you first learn Ebola was here? When was the first time you heard there was a case?,HMK:  We first heard of Ebola in Guinea and Liberia. Sierra Leone was the last country that had Ebola in the West Coast of Africa. ,,,,,,,Q: When was that? Do you remember the first case?,"HMK:  We had the first case of Ebola on May 24, 2014.",,,,Q: Who was the first case?,"HMK: It was a little boy. Stories were coming out that it was a boy who had a monkey infected with Ebola that first brought Ebola into the country. Later on, we got stories of traditional birth attendants who went to Liberia, delivered a case, came back to Kailahun in the eastern part of Sierra Leone, and then started experiencing signs of Ebola. But of course, stories were scanty about Ebola. We never had the full complement of knowing how it is transmitted and how to prevent it and how to manage it. ",,,,,,Q: Go on then. Tell me what happened after you heard of this first case.,"HMK: As the Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer we had to start having meetings in the ministry with partners, with WHO [World Health Organization]. We also had the involvement of UNFPA [United Nations Population Fund], the involvement of UNICEF [United Nations Children’s Fund], UN organizations and also other INGOs [international non-governmental organizations]. We started having meetings, making sure that we find ways of preventing the disease from coming into Sierra Leone. ","We also started having training for us nurses and midwives, because we never had a structure for IPC. That was when we decided to have an IPC unit in the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. We appointed a coordinator who was a nurse. ","We had a team. We also had focal points in all the district health management teams, so that we could form a bigger body that would be representative of the whole country. Even with that, we had the first case. ",Q: Is there a history of nurses being involved in the highest levels of government?,"HMK: Yes. Starting from the ministry level. I was part of the case management committee. I was also part of the coordinating committee, because at that level, we needed to know how to prevent our nurses from getting infected and how to manage cases that are infected. We had support from the UN [United Nations] and from international organizations to start doing training. Public Health England. The British. We also had the Chinese medical team to show us about donning and doffing. It was also a nursing and midwifery thing because we were hands-on, and the job we do is a hands-on job, because you cannot care for a patient if you don’t touch.",,,"Q: Yes, we’re hands. Nursing is hands-on.","HMK: And unfortunately, it’s a disease of contact. And so sadly, even though we were training and retraining, refreshing, providing PPEs [personal protective equipment], making sure that the nurses were protected, we lost 153 nurses and midwives to Ebola from 2014 to 2016.",,,,,Q: One hundred fifty-three.,"HMK: From maternal and child health assistants to traditional birth attendants, to community nurses, to state registered nurses, even to BSc [Bachelor of Science] nurses, we lost so many of them, both male and female, to the disease. But if not for nurses and midwives, it would have been difficult for the disease to be contained because it was us, frontline workers, who were there as frontline workers, to make sure that we care for those patients. ","Being the chief nurse at that time, I was like the frontliners, because I had to mobilize resources for training to be conducted and make sure I got nurses willing to work in Ebola centers. Because they were hearing their colleagues were getting infected and dying, a lot of them were getting scared to be part of the response. I had to be moving from district to district, from hospital to hospital, just to talk to them, to mobilize, for them to make sure that they’re part of the process in a way that did not get them infected. ",Q: Could you describe a day? Take one day. What time did you start? Where would you go? How many nurses would come? Just talk me through one day of what it was like.,"HMK: At first, about only twenty of them came. On completion of the training, I had to go with them, because you had to reassure them. I had to go with them to the very first Ebola treatment center. Some of them even met me there waiting, because they were all scared. I had to talk to them, mobilize them. But honestly, to be true to myself, I was thinking these are daughters, wives, husbands, and now, I am now convincing them to go and work for Ebola. What if they get infected? I felt very guilty. I know it’s a hard job. But fortunately, of all those we trained, it was only one that got infected, and she survived.",,,,"Q: What a burden on you. What a heavy burden, responsibility you carried.","HMK: It was a burden. It was. Sometimes at night, certain hospitals were left vacant. The nurses were running away. You have to go to every hospital to make sure you have staff to work, you know? And also, more important, we were discriminated against. There’s a lot of stigma and discrimination.",,,,Q: Against?,HMK: Against us. The public against the nurses.,,,Q: Because? Explain why. Explain the stigma.,"HMK: Because the public had the feeling, the perception that it was the nurses who were spreading the Ebola. The nurses were thinking that it’s the public that brings the Ebola from home to the hospitals. It was very challenging. It came to a point when nurses wouldn’t agree to put on uniforms to go to work.",,"Q: So that they wouldn’t be identified. Can you talk a little about how the ministry—how you as the nursing leader of the country approached the community, approached the public to educate them? What was done?","HMK: Well, there was a lot of sensitization. We had billboards. We had pin-ups. We also had posters, and there were radio discussions. We would go periodically to radio stations, to television stations, to tell the public how to protect themselves, how to keep safe. If they think they had symptoms that look like Ebola symptoms, they’re supposed to report to the hospitals, but that also was a challenge, because people never wanted to be stigmatized. They are going to hide it. That was how it spread over the country. People were taught that when someone dies of Ebola that person should not be touched. You should notify the ministry. But they would wash the bodies and bury them, following traditional practices.",,"Q: Who were the allies in the communities? Who did you go to—death practices are so sacred in cultures, right?","HMK: Traditional leaders. The religious leaders. We also had the traditional birth attendants who were in communities. Meetings were called for traditional leaders and by-laws were put in certain areas to say if you have a sick person, and you don’t report, you’ll be held responsible if anything goes wrong. Everybody was involved. It was like a standstill in the country. There was nothing going on except the response to Ebola and making sure people are prevented from getting Ebola. ","We had the bottom-top approach. When it started, initially, it was like a top-bottom approach, because it was new. We didn’t know how to handle it. We changed to a bottom-top approach, starting from the community level and then moving upwards. ","Sometimes, when you want the information, you go talk to the little children around and ask them was there any sick person around here? Did they bury anybody? Sometimes they tell you. Yes, there was a sick person. He or she died, and that’s the grave. And what they do is plant potato leaves and cassava leaves on the graves just so people can think these are just heaps of vegetables. It became very difficult at that point to manage, but continuously, the messages were going out that if we don’t contain, we don’t try to prevent, it will be difficult for us to get Ebola out of the country.",Q: What role did nurses play in educating the communities?,"HMK: We were also a part of the sensitization teams. Starting from the ministry level, since I was there, I would go on television and the radio with my team. We talked about signs and symptoms, prevention, also making sure that they don’t wash and bury the dead. And of course, we were treating. We were the frontliners in treatment, and we were mobilizing from one point to another, making sure that we passed the information out.",,,Q: How did you take care of yourself during this time?,"HMK: It was scary. At one point, it was like I was just a few meters between myself and Ebola, moving from one place to another, from one Ebola center to another. I had gloves on most of the time. Sometimes wearing PPEs and boots. oMst of the time. At the epicenter in Kenema, I had certain nurses who, for as long as they knew I’d be arriving, had chlorine in readiness. I was even afraid of passing the night in Kenema. I wouldn’t sleep there. Even if it was late, I would leave and come back to Freetown ","And most of the nurses who died were those who were working at that epicenter at that time, because having just minimal knowledge about how to prevent themselves when it started, some of them had to be using what most of the patients were using, and some of them even by just minor mistakes got infected. ",Q: What did your family—how did they react to all of this?,"HMK: They were even more scared than I [was]. My parents lived in Makeni, in the north of Sierra Leone, and most times when I moved from one point to another, I wouldn’t let them know. They would tell me you have to be careful, make sure you don’t go to areas where there are so many victims. But I had to do my job. I had no option at that time. ","And I also can remember a day when I almost got infected. We were helping develop the first Ebola treatment center at the police training school, and we didn’t have a proper mortuary. There was this patient who had died of Ebola and was lying down somewhere, but their eyes were open. I thought he was just lying there. I was moving toward him. A doctor behind my back shouted, [claps] “oh, move away, move away. That’s an Ebola—not a patient really, because the man was dead. He said, [claps] move away! Don’t go too close. That’s an infected corpse.” I was very near to almost getting Ebola. It wasn’t a good experience. We had to go as frontliners. ",Q: What kept you going?,"HMK: What kept me going was the fact that I know I’m a nurse, and I’ve pledged to serve in whatever capacity, so I had to. As the chief nurse, you have to lead and the others follow, and there is no way I can step backwards. If you are supposed to lead, and you stay back, then you will not encourage the others to follow, so I had to stay and stick and just led. I had no option. Not that I wasn’t afraid. I was.",,"Q: Could you talk for a moment about the connection to you having this unimaginable courage and persistence in staying in an unimaginable situation as a woman, the connection between you being a nursing leader and a woman?","HMK: These are two unfortunate situations. In Sierra Leone, generally, a woman should not lead. We live in a man’s world where the men just think we should always follow them, follow instructions, so it’s very challenging for you to be able to lead and survive and succeed. ","As a nurse, it makes it even more painful. because generally, we are not appreciated by the doctors and by other professionals, because we have community health workers and community health officers who always think they are ahead of nurses and midwives. Of course, the doctors, the doctors always think well, we are in charge, we’re in control. Being a woman and being a nurse means you will go through painful experiences and situations in life. There are times even as a leader, a nurse leader, even when you have a vision for your nurses, and you think they should go this way, you always have the doctors, the men, because most of the doctors are men who tell you no, we want it this way, that’s how it should go. ","In Sierra Leone, people just think nurses are individuals who drop out of school, who cannot make it, who are not educated enough, who end up being nurses. Of course, you know your potential, what you can do. You feel hurt for somebody to think of you that way. Because of that, they give you instructions. They tell you what to do. Even when you know what to do, they tell you what to do, because they think it should go the way they want it, which is very frustrating. And you’re a woman.","These are two disadvantaged positions, as a nurse and also as a woman, even at the ministry level. Sometimes, you have to force your way, even in meetings, because you’re a part of top management. You have to force your way for them to listen to you. There are times as soon as you start to talk, they’ll interrupt—sometimes I have to stand my ground, to say no, you have to listen. You have to listen first, and then you make your comments afterwards. ","There are moments you think if I had known, I’d have chosen another profession because of the way people look at you. And even the public. When I was in office, I tried to make sure people understand that we are not dropouts. We are partners in health. We augment each other to make sure we have wellness and protect the public. It’s really difficult. It is. I assure you.","Q: Thinking about having led the nursing profession and midwifery profession through this crisis of Ebola, what would you have done differently? What would you want to do before or when another outbreak happens, since they’re bound to come back to all of us around the world? What would you want to do differently? What were your big lessons that you gathered from this?","HMK: I think it would be good if we can also sensitize the public to understand that nurses are also educated like any professionals, and nursing is a profession, like all other professions, like the doctors, the engineers, the accountants, the lawyers. ","And so when I was in office, I’d sometimes go on radio and television to let people understand that there are several levels in nursing. You can have a nurse who has a PhD, like Joan Shepherd. You can also have a nurse who has a master’s degree. I was so happy when we started having the BSc nurses in Sierra Leone, because people just think nurses can never have a degree. And because of that, nobody places value on the work they do. They don’t think nurses are intellectuals, you know. Once we started having BSc nurses becoming first degree holders and master’s degree holders, the picture changed a little, but we need more of that. ","Q: And in terms of response to epidemics, what would you do differently as a nursing leader? How would you change the system? What would you do if we got a call while we’re sitting here saying there’s a new outbreak? What would you want done differently?","HMK: The very first thing we did that was different that never existed was establishing the IPC system. And that I want to be maintained at every level. We also need to have more nurses into training for epidemics, for epidemics responses. We don’t need to be reactive all of the time. We need to be proactive, meaning we should have for every district hospital, for every district medical team, there should be nurses who are trained for any epidemic, to respond to any epidemic. And I think in a way, we have learned our lessons.  ","As a ministry, we developed the emergency operation center, the EOC. And in the EOC, they train nurses, doctors, and other health professionals on how to respond to epidemics. The public health emergency and security directorate has been established. There are nurses working in those areas. And those areas need to be sustained so that in future, for as long as there’s an epidemic or even an epidemic in neighboring countries, they should be reactivated to start the response immediately, so that we will not end up losing so many lives and so many of our professionals.","Q: Where would you have nursing be in all of this in terms of policy, leadership? What’s your vision, because you hold the highest position within nursing and midwifery?","HMK: nursing and midwifery. So we had to develop one, just after the epidemic. It will have a policy statement, including occupational health and safety, and of course the IPC component. That has been translated to a strategic plan, and a strategic plan has been launched by the president.",Q: Congratulations.,"HMK: It’s a plan that is now being worked on to make sure that nurses also have a sense of direction. Nurses have been trained periodically. We also have made sure every unit has a focal point for IPC, and they in turn also have focal points in every unit for every ward. Periodically, they meet and get supplies, to make sure they protect and prevent themselves, and also prevent relatives who come into hospitals. That has to be maintained, so that in future, if there’s an outbreak, whatever outbreak, at least there are structures in place to control the outbreak.",
n34,Diana T. Sarteh,Diana,T,Sarteh,Susan Michaels-Strasser,15-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,"Deputy Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer, Ministry of Health","Diana T. Sarteh is the Deputy Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer at the Ministry of Health in Liberia. During the Ebola epidemic, she worked at John F. Kennedy Medical Center as a nurse and a nursing supervisor. After the treatment center at JFK closed down, she worked at the treatment center at the Ministry of Defense.","Q: If you could start by telling me where you currently work, and then where you were during the Ebola crisis. ","DTS: I work at the Ministry of Health. During the Ebola outbreak, I worked at JFK [John F. Kennedy] Medical Center, as a nursing supervisor, for fifteen years. While at the hospital I heard people dying of Ebola, hospitals were shutting down, and I was in charge of the surgical ward, where we had burn cases, we had orthopedic cases, we had patients with surgical problems, and we were still on the ward. Because of the Ebola most of the nurses were staying home and most of the patients were trying to run away. Being the head of the ward, I had to stay there to encourage the patients and to encourage the staff.","JFK established an ETU just to hold a few patients. But they had the ELWA ETU. I had to come in the hospital to take care of about forty to forty-five patients, talk to the nurse aides to help me take care of patients that needed daily dressing, burn patients. There came a time when I told the administration that we had to discharge these patients that were in the hospital just for care, so they discharged a few patients, and there were only Ebola patients on the ward. I had friends in the ETU who were not taken care and most of them died. When the aides carried food to them they pushed the food under the door with their legs, because no one wanted to take care of Ebola patients. And we were not trained as Ebola heroes. We were not trained how to take all the necessary precautions. I had a doctor who was very, very passionate about his job, and he came down with Ebola. He used to work at JFK, and he used to work at the ELWA hospital. He got infected at the Catholic Hospital. He was the surgeon for my department.  When I found out that he was in the ETU, and the first set of people that were in the ETU all died, I felt so bad. ","One day a friend of mine came and said, “Diana, every day we come to JFK but we don’t have work to do. All the patients have been discharged, and we are sitting. They are going to recruit people to work in the ETU.” I said, “Where is it? Where is the doctor?” I said, “I want to go there to work, because I want to go and take care of him, take care of those that I worked with before.” When I got at the ETU, there was a team of Ugandans. They said everyone was standing on the line to put their names—some few nurses and PAs [physicians assistants] were standing on the line to put their names down.",,,Q: So people were standing in lines to put their name down.,"DTS: But I didn’t know their motives. Some were thinking about working maybe because there was a lot of money in the ETU. Some thought about working in the ETU because of their passion, they didn’t want for people to die, like me. When we started working we weren’t trained. We weren’t trained on the protective equipment.  We were even still writing our names to be recruited when cars were at the gate to bring patients in, a thirty-five-bed hospital for the Ebola patients. And that very day we started taking care of patients. They brought a suit, goggles, the mask, all the protective equipment. They just said, “Well, you have to wear it like this. Put it on like this. Put it on like this.”",,,,,,"Q: So they just taught you right there, and you went right in.","DTS: Right there. “You wear it like this, wear it like this.” We were so excited, and we  brought the patients in. But I’m good at establishing IV [intravenous] lines, so when they came in--they were fifty, twenty-five in line--I took the chair, sat, and as you come to me in my suit I will just open your line. When the Ugandans saw my work and saw how passionate I was for the patients, after two weeks they decided to make me their nursing supervisor for the unit. I had a shift running with nurses.",,,Q: You started shifts.,"DTS: Yes, I started recruiting nurses. And after two weeks, we started going for training, had the co-training, the ETU training.",,,,,,,Q: Where did you go for the training?,"DTS: They had a hotel, the Corina Hotel. A group of Americans and other people came, the WHO [World Health Organization]. WHO trained me in ETU management. When I got back to the ETU I started to train nurses, and we started to run shifts. I used to go in the ETU with my staff. We’d spend four hours in that suit establishing IV lines, giving bed bath, feeding patients. Sometimes when you enter the Ebola unit, you see patients lying in a pool of blood, and you have to go there, clean up the blood, ensure they have IV lines established with the fluids. We took care of these patients until after a few days, few weeks, they started being conscious. I noticed that in the ETU, once you have patients losing a lot of fluid, vomiting, passing stool, establishing an intravenous line, and giving fluid, was one of the best methods to resuscitate a patient.",,,,Q: How did you manage with your family in these circumstances?,"DTS: And even though I know family comes first, but I took an oath to save lives. I know my ability when it comes to my profession, when it comes to my career. I love nursing, whether in the dangerous part of wherever I find myself, I will apply those skills that as a nurse you should apply. There will be nothing that will stop me from doing things for people once it comes to saving their lives. Many times we have patients whose smell is offensive, and nurses will not want to touch them, not want to come closer to them. But I will go there, help them, be by them, establish their IV lines, clean their wounds. And they would say, “Thank you.” They would say, “Thank you, Diana.”",,,,,,Q: Did their knowing your name help to keep you going? Was there one patient in particular?,"DTS: You know, while I was in the unit I saw this one patient who every time we entered the unit, this patient, you just feel like he’s going to die today. usually when you enter the Ebola unit—we have our names written on our back, or on the forehead, so the patients will recognize us, but we wouldn’t recognize them because of their conditions. ",,,Q: But this one knew your name.,"DTS: Yes, he knew my name, and he asked, “Is this Diana, the supervisor, under ","these clothes?” I said, “Yes. You just came in today?” And he said, “No, I’m the one who’s been lying down, you’ve been taking care.” I said, “Wow! I’m so happy.” You know? And these things are things that make me happy, and once you see the end result of your work, yes, you see the end",,Q: How long was the ETU open at JFK?,DTS: It was open at JFK for three months.,,,,,Q: And then tell me about what happened next.,"DTS: We moved to the Ministry of Defense where it was better. There were systems in place. We had a well-organized structure, because with the help of the foreign team that came, and I was also trained again by them, we recruited more nurses. We set up the place, and it was so conducive for the patients. Most of the patients admitted at the Ministry of Defense, most of them walked home.",Q: Wow.,"DTS: We had a life tree at the Ministry of Defense. When you get out of the unit, you put your name on the tree, tree of life. We would look at the number of names on the trees, on the tree; we would know that, yes, our effort has not gone in vain. ","Q: Could you talk more about how it was different, those systems, or how—what was different about it?","DTS: It was the process of triage? We triaged patients according to priorities. We had the suspected, the probable, and the case area. At the MOD [Ministry of Defense] we had a system where we had a place for you. We even sit for observation. Most of the time we’d put patients in suspected areas and discharge them, because they weren’t Ebola patients. So that was the system that they put in place. Secondly, we had a time for medication. ",,,Q: Like a set time.,"DTS: Yes, we had a set time for medications. We had a set time for feeding, for care. So we placed the nurses in those different areas. “You are going for feeding. I’m going for medication.” Medication in terms of establishing IV lines, and inserting whatsoever. That’s medication. “You go in there for care. You’re going to do your bed bath, make sure the patient’s surrounding is very clean and conducive and comfortable.” So those are systems that we put in place where, as you enter the unit, you know what you are going to do, and not just every time on the unit everybody just doing things that they don’t even understand.",,,,Q: So there was order and control.,"DTS: So that was—yes, there was order and control in the unit. We had music, where patients could listen to music, listen to the radio. And they mounted this large sound system where you play music, and they would be listening. That was one of the reasons why they walked out of the unit. I even had a time where we would share clothes with them. Make them feel comfortable. Get towels. Get those things that they can munch on to take in the unit to them. So they were living their normal life; it’s just that they were ill, and they had to be— But they were well taken care of. It was so interesting.",,,Q: What do you think—what is one of the biggest things you learned from that experience?,"DTS: I learned that you have to be qualified. You have to be a trained practitioner before entering such a place, otherwise you get infected. Not just anybody can work in the ETU. You have to be trained. And you have to be a real nurse, because even if you’re a nurse and you don’t have passion for your profession, you will just enter the unit, look at patients and pass by them. ",,"Q: What are you most proud of from that time, and the work you did?","DTS: That I worked in an Ebola unit with Ebola patients. That is the pride that I have. Most people would not work there, but I’m proud that I can be counted among the nurses that worked in the Ebola unit, even if I don’t get anything, because during the whole Ebola crisis we did not benefit anything. There wasn’t any scholarship to say, oh, these nurses did a lot. They sacrificed their lives. They worked tirelessly on those years  But at least after this whole episode, at least we must appreciate them, even if it is a training out of the country, even it is a training that will improve their lives. It should be happening for them, but it wasn’t done. Even our hazard benefits for entering the unit, for working with Ebola patients, for risking our lives, we were deprived of it.",,Q: You didn’t get that. ,"DTS: No, not at all. We were not given anything. We were given certificates for working in the unit, but no one recognized that. No one even called us to say, “Let us give them an award.” Nurses risked their lives, but when it came to awards, they called doctors. Nurses were the ones who were doing the dirty work. Nurses were the ones who were establishing IV lines. We were not recognized. I wasn’t recognized. Because being a nursing supervisor for the largest ETU in Monrovia, and other government officials’ relatives are there, and they walked out, they went home, and no one recognizes that.",,,Q: Were other health professionals recognized?,"DTS: In the unit, I think only one person, because he was a doctor, and he was the head for the unit, after everything. They sent him to London School of Tropical Medicine to do his master’s. And that was it. While we were here struggling to get our master’s, and he left.",,,Q: How does that make you feel?,"DTS: Very bad. It made me feel bad, not because I took care of patients. But I ","needed the recognition that I did it, I was a part of it. I was a part of it. I think I should be recognized for that. ",Q: You were so brave. So incredibly brave. It’s okay.,"DTS: You sit. You sit home and listen to the radio, and they are recognizing doctors? It’s not fair.","DTS: To be a nurse in Liberia, you must sacrifice, it’s just the passion. Because you know, people are saying things that are not not right in the hospitals. They don’t want to know the root cause, right? They just want to say, “Oh, nurses are not taking care of patients. Nurses are not doing this. Oh, nurses don’t have time for patients.” But they don’t want to know how nurses feel. They don’t want to know what would satisfy nurses. I can be a nurse and go in the Ebola unit. I’m not being paid for two, three months. I have my children who— But yet, and still I sacrifice, take care of patients. Well, after taking care of the patients, I go home and I hear the doctor of that unit is going to London for service, and he said nurses are not doing it. How will I do it when I don’t know it, when I’m not trained, I’m not being capacitated? How will I do it?",Q: And you did it.,"DTS: Yes. You just want to leave me to where I am? You don’t want me to improve my life? Or you want to complain and say nurses are not doing this in Liberia, nurses don’t know this? When it comes to the nursing profession, nurses are very, very skillful. In other countries, before you establish IV line you need to use an ultrasound. You need to apply it to see where the vein is, or nurses will just start and apply the tourniquet and they go in, they are in. I just think that being a nurse in Liberia is a waste. That’s how I feel. And I’ve been working for fifteen years., I have worked with surgeons. I was trained by a Chinese surgeon. They want you to do the work, and they don’t recognize that, yes, you did it. So that’s why: because of my hard work, because of my dedicated job, because I’m patient, I was appointed as Deputy Chief Nursing & Midwifery Officer, and that’s where I am right now.",,Q: At the Ministry.,"DTS: Yes. Most of the nurses, everyone who knows me, knows that I have worked ","with my whole heart. But nurses need to be recognized for the job they do, and that’s the hurtful part, and that’s what kills me when it comes—that’s—it weakens my strength. ",,,,"Q: Yes. What would you like—if you could say one thing to the Director of the WHO, what would you say?","DTS: I would ask him to provide some training skills to improve my capacity as a nurse, anywhere EVA [phonetic] is in Lofa, to provide our means, to improve my skills. I would ask him for that assistance, to come back in my country and train nurses who are passionate about their profession.",,"Q: Is there anything else you would like to put down, have recorded, understood? About you as a nurse, about the work at that time, or more generally?","DTS: Yes, I have a documentary that I gave during the Ebola crisis, and it’s documented. A day in a life of an Ebola nurse in Liberia. That is something that you need to see, how we worked during the Ebola crisis, what are some of the recommendations you will make on my behalf as a nurse. A CBS News reporter did an interview, and she followed me all the way in the unit. It’s there. You can take a look at it.",,,,,,
n35,Numu B. Charm,Numu,B,Charm,Margaret Loma Phiri,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,Nurse Educator and Nursing Officer at a Government Hospital.,"Numu B. Charm is currently a nurse educator and nursing officer. Charm also assists nursing faculty at the College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences. During the Ebola outbreak, Charm trained nurses at an Ebola Treatment Center in Moyamba as well as in Freetown and Kerry Town.","Q: So, welcome to this discussion. I want us to feel free, feel relaxed, and share the experiences that you went through this period when we had Ebola in the country. Let me just start by knowing who you are. ",NBC: I’m a nurse educator and a nursing officer presently at Government Hospital and also giving a helping hand at the faculty of nursing inside COMAHS [College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences]. ,,,,,"Q: When this tragedy happened—the advent of Ebola, when it started—how did you know about it? ","NBC: Well, at first when it started, we didn’t know that it was Ebola until a lady, a woman—according to the story a woman went to visit relatives in a neighboring country, Guinea. And there, the family was sick and she assisted them. Upon her return again to Freetown—not to Freetown, the Provinces—she also had an attack. She died. Why it wasn’t investigated to find out whether it was Ebola, who knows? Until after two more relatives in the same home died. And that got an alarm for them to investigate the cause of death. After that, the outbreak came slowly and silently, gradually building up to a burst of cases in late May and early June in 2014. I think—can I just get my memories back? [papers shuffle] Yes, in 2014. ","After that dramatic incident, here was a cause to investigate. It was revealed that the family in that Guinea, a neighboring country, was having Ebola. It was traced and confirmed that it was Ebola. ","But at that time the government viewed the expansion of cases as political. “Oh no, it is not Ebola.” They just wanted to keep people with them. Not until April did the county then step up vigilance for important cases. When two members of that same family died from the Ebola Virus Disease, after that the WHO [World Health Organization] confirmed this.","It started in the southeast. A vigilance team was created. People should not travel from one town to another. In public places, people should not be gathered, no public functions. Until this thing started spreading, people were still traveling. This is how it spread into the east, which is Freetown. ",,,"Q: Now, when the number of cases were increasing, what did the government do?","NBC: Well, other health workers and professionals from other countries came and said that people were dying—especially one prominent doctor who was attached at Kenema or Kailahun, Dr. Khan, died and two other prominent doctors again followed. That was when the government thought: “Oh, we are now losing prominent people.” Other people from government, other international partners came to help us. And surveillance teams were strengthened. IPC supporters helped us to put that in place for us to know what has to be done and how to go about it, so that we can protect ourselves, the community, and the patients we are having contact with. At first, there was not enough PPE, Personal Protection Equipment. The country was lacking, to be honest.",,,Q: You didn’t have enough of those materials?,"NBC: No. Because for gloves, the ordinary gloves we were using were a problem. We had not faced this type of situation when I was in nursing school.",,,,,,,Q: It was really the first time—,"NBC: Yes, the first time.",,,,"Q: That the country experienced this and it was also the first time that most of you were actually exposed to this type of tragedy. So, what was your role in terms of care provision and managing the situation, I should say?","NBC: There was an emergency meeting, and the Chief Nursing Officers chose some nurses to be supervisors in most of the hospitals. I was fortunate to be a supervisor at my own hospital, supervising the nurses so that they would not become infected. Supervising them how to do handwashing; also teaching them about PPE, Personal Protection Equipment, how to prepare themselves when they receive a patient, whether that patient has Ebola or not; to see that the hospital is in good hygienic condition; to see to the welfare of the nurses and how the nurses are doing their work. I was one of the supervisors. ","But as time went by, the cases kept increasing. I was then trained again and sent by WHO [World Health Organization] to Moyamba to go and teach the community and also the nurses at one Ebola center how to prevent themselves from becoming infected. That was my role.",,,,,"Q: So, you were being taught and prepared for the supervisory role that you were—","NBC: Yes, yes.",,,Q: Given. What type of information were you being taught? What were the things that you were supposed to be doing and things that you were not supposed to be doing?,"NBC: Well, when I went to the Kerry Town, we were trained again by the internationals that came to assist us. We were taught how to put on the PPE and how to surveil cases. Then the response when there is a case—because when there is a case, they will alert the center that we are coming with five or so patients, so be ready. So, I’d get my nurses alert, everything to put in place. “See that? What should be in the center there to be ready to collect information and to take care of the patients?” We were taught how to analyze as a supervisor.  I usually would go inside the unit or ward to see how my nurses are performing so that they would not become infected. If, for instance, they forgot, I’d be there to alert them, “No, don’t do this. If you do this or you should miss this, you’ll become infected.” ",,,Q:  How did you mobilize the communities? You said you went to Kenema—,"NBC: To Moyamba. We were all there to facilitate the training. They needed community workers, they needed nurses to know how to do their job, their dos and don’ts.",,,,,Q: What exactly were you teaching the communities?,"NBC: We taught them the signs and symptoms of Ebola, how to put on PPE, how to do hand washing whenever they come in contact with body fluid and vomit from patients, then how to put on the PPE and how to remove it so that they don’t become infected. Because the non-health staff are also going in the center and in the ward to clean, you also have to teach them how to do this cleaning without becoming infected.",,Q: Did you have enough resources for managing the situations of different cases?,"NBC: At Giema there were not enough resources to be honest. The nurses would say, “I’m not going to touch that patient if I’m gloveless.” And then you’re nervous. Everybody at that time was scared. They would not touch patients without proper PPE. That was one of our challenges at that time. But, when people started donating from different countries, it was better for the protective gears. For Kerry Town there were enough. We did not have a problem.",,,,Q: You didn’t?,NBC: There were enough materials. And even incentives were given to us that we appreciated.,,,,Q: What were the incentives? In the form of money?,"NBC: Yes, money, but we also had two meals per day at Kerry Town, breakfast and lunch, because there were three shifts--the morning, afternoon, and the night shift. ",,,"Q: So, from your interaction with the patients, what sort of experience did that bring to you? How did you feel about the whole tragedy?","NBC: The whole tragedy for some patients, you would see that the whole family would have been wiped off. In some instances, the children, the father had been wiped off by the Ebola virus, only the mother remained. In others, the mother and the children were wiped off, only the head of the family, the father, remained. These stories are so pathetic. Somebody would be there, crying, “Oh, where’s my mother? Where’s my sister? I’m dying.” So, we assured her  “You’re not dying. Just keep on the faith and we can do what we are able to do to make you survive.”","And for me also, my mother would say, “Hey, make sure when you’re from that center, you clean your gear before entering my house.” I said, “We are being taught. And I know by the grace of Allah, nothing will befall me —",Q: Yes—,"NBC: So, whenever I come to my house, I make sure I take off everything that day, undress on the veranda before the children would come, say, “Hey, Mommy,” and hug me. I would say, “No, wait until I have my bath before you come to me.” ","At first my husband was against my working. I said, “No, I’m going to serve my country. This is the time I should show my loyalty to my country. If I become afraid of this dreadful situation, then what made me become a nurse? Please.” So, I had to involve his elder brother and the other brother who said, “Allow her to serve her country, please.” And my husband finally agreed.","Q: It was not easy. So, how did you work with people from outside the country? The people who came to help you, how was their input coordinated?","NBC: We worked amicably. They would come, organize a workshop and training, to see how we are going about our own procedures. Their procedures would combine with ours, and teaching would go on before we worked with them. If not for the international intervention, I wonder where we would be at that time. We alone were not able to manage our situation.",,,"Q: Do you remember some of the organizations that you worked with or that supported, for example, the activities at the centers where you were?","NBC: Save the Children from different countries came. Colleagues from America, England, maybe from Canada. But it was Save the Children that manned the Kerry Town station, in partnership with the WHO.",,,"Q: Now, what do you think you managed to do well, despite the challenges during that time? What were the things that you learned that you did well?","NBC: To be honest, there was no proper data collection. Data collection remains one of our challenges, record keeping too. Infection Prevention Control is still also a challenge. It was during this Ebola virus that we were taught properly how to do handwashing. And because of this situation, we are able now to clean all of our personal protective equipment. We are now aware that we should dress properly before touching any type of patient, what you should do and not do. It was the Ebola crisis that brought awareness of how to manage and take care of patients properly. ",,Q: How do you think the community is still behaving in terms of sticking to some of the messages that they were taught?,"NBC: It is really difficult. During sensitization, you’d see handwashing stations. But now because the outbreak is no more, they are neglected. Some people are compliant. But others are not. It is not easy.",,"Q: So, if you have to tell us, some of the nurses from other countries who may not have experienced the Ebola or any epidemic, what message would you share about your leadership role in the epidemic as a frontline worker?","NBC: Well, I would say, “Nurse, if you have gone through training, you should not be afraid to be a leader and role model, because of what we are taught and believe we put in practice. And you should have confidence.” Most of the nurses in the front line had little or no knowledge, and so no confidence in working. They got themselves infected. But with my own experience that I had during the Ebola crisis, I know I will work anywhere with any epidemic diseases.","I will not be afraid. I will be vigilant. Once I have been trained and I have knowledge, I want to extend my knowledge and put my training into practice. So, I think [laughs] I will be a champion. [laughs]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n36,Wilhelmina W.G. Flomo,Wilhelmina,WG,Flomo,Annette Mwansa Nkowane,15-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,"President, Liberia Midwives Association","Wilhelmina WG Flomo is a registered midwife and has been the president of the Liberia Midwives Association since 2017. During the Ebola epidemic, she worked at Duport Road Health Center, continuing to provide the community local to the center with necessary healthcare.",Q: Where were you when the Ebola outbreak began and how long have you been working as a nurse midwife?,"WF: I have been a midwife for twenty-one years. Let me clarify that I’ve also been the president the Liberia Midwives Association since 2017. During the Ebola years I worked as a midwife, too. ","I personally worked at the Duport Road Health Center at that time.  It was not an Ebola unit, but it catered to the health needs of the community, especially pregnant women because during the Ebola, most of the health centers and hospitals were closed to patients. Duport Road, the facility remained open and we midwives were to work throughout.","It was challenging, too, because at a certain point in time there were no materials to work with so we had to step back and wait for materials to come. We went through a series of workshops, where we were taught infection prevention control techniques where you have to be fully attired when playing with body fluids. So, being a midwife, I knew that those were all things that would put a person at risk for Ebola. But in as much as those were steps that we needed to follow, we still needed to save lives. So, we did not ̶ I did not stay away. ",,,Q: Did some of the midwives become infected?,"WF: We had a colleague caring for a pregnant woman, and she became positive. And then another one who was caring for a patient also became positive and died. It was scary. It was difficult for us as midwives hearing that our colleagues are also caring for patients and they have also become victims of this Ebola virus. So, it was difficult for us and it was also difficult for family members, especially the midwife who died. She was well-known in her community. She cared so much for pregnant women and even for clients who came across her and in the process of caring, and she became infected. ","So, it was kind of difficult and it was scary knowing that your colleague was providing care and she came down with the virus. So, you see yourself every day, as you leave your house, you feel that—it was like when I was leaving my house, I felt like I was going on the battlefront. If I’m not fortunate I could get positive from caring for patients. So, it was kind of traumatizing for us who were working during that Ebola season.",,,,,Q: Was there any guidance given to you how to be safe? You say you did training —,"WF: Yes, we did training. We were trained on this SQS [Safe and Quality Services]. And the organization that trained us, we had Médicins du Monde.",,,Q: Médicins du Monde?,"WF: Yes, they were the ones who provided training for us at our facility on how to care for the patient, how to use this PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] and how to remove it. And it wasn’t just one training, it was like a sequence. Every other week you would have one or two persons coming to talk with you, to talk with the staff that was working, and give you updates on changes or on new findings. That was how we got knowledge on how to use preventive measures and even how to evaluate if a patient has Ebola, the signs and symptoms, too. It was continuous and a process. You get on the radio, you hear it. We had organizations coming every nine, ten, sometimes every other week to give updates and encouragement. And then at close to the end of the—not the end of the Ebola—around August, September, the Midwifery Association leadership also took the lead to go to these facilities who had midwives working to encourage them and also to continue to remind them to take preventive measures while caring for their patients.",,,,,,,"Q: Just tell me a bit about your life. I can see your passion in what you did. How did you want to become a midwife?  And your education, your family. Are there any mentors in your life that really motivated you to be who you are?",WF: Yes. I had an aunt who was a midwife.,"My mother’s younger sister. She was a midwife. And it was because of her that I developed that passion of becoming a midwife even when I was out of grade school, going into the end of my high school years. I admired her so much especially when she’s dressed and caring for these patients. And because of that she had a lot of friends. When she was walking in the community, this mother would come and run to her. “Oh, this is the lady who helped me when I was in labor.” And you know, from there I started falling in love with this profession. ","I did not think about getting into the profession because there were riches in it. But I had a passion, that love for mothers, labor and delivery. ","When I was a kid, when I’d see a woman pregnant, I would feel that that lady is filled; she is not to eat. And sometimes when she’d go and put to birth, when she’d come back, she went and found this baby. Where did she find this fine baby? But I didn’t even know that she was carrying a child. But when I started having this knowledge that a child grows in an adult, within another adult. And then that person is the one that is to put that baby in this world. I thought, how can this happen? How should this happen? This must be a miracle. Even in my first month in midwifery school I was like going to the delivery room to see that process. And my first experience was like, “This is God’s wonder. It’s not man’s but God’s.” Sorry if I’m talking about God, because I’m a Christian. ",Q: What did you use to protect yourself?,"WF: Gloves and then we used plastic bags. We use longer plastic bags. And we had the rain boots, a plastic apron, and masks. ","And when I went home—because as I said earlier, during the whole Ebola period while I was working at that facility, I told my family that I cannot stop. To be frank, when the Ebola intensified, my husband called me and said, “Your friends are not going to work. Why can’t you sit?” Well, what I told him was, “If I sit in my home I can’t help anybody. We are going through training so we know how to prevent ourselves.” But when I was leaving the facility going home, I was worried. Who are these patients I have interacted with? Are they positive? Or are they in the late incubation period where you don’t know that this person is positive? ","I had a child who in 2014 was just four years. How are you going to keep away from that child? Because as soon as I come home from work, “Mama is coming home!” He’s going to rush to me and hold me tight. So when I got home, I would say, “When I come from work, nobody come around me. Stay away.” But it was difficult because those were our kids. When you are sitting as a mother, that child will come unknowingly, come and rub on you. It was difficult. But we did what we could do.",,,,"Q: So, is there anything that stands out about what you used to do before Ebola and what you’re doing now?","WF: Before the Ebola, to be frank, as a health worker during our course of study before getting to become a professional, we knew that you had to take universal precautions. But we actually did not observe those precautions at many times when we were doing procedures--hand-washing—before you touch your patient, wash your hands; after you touch this patient, wash your hands, in between patients, wash your hands—it was not so before the Ebola. It was like the Ebola virus disease was terrible, but it was also an eye-opener to us health workers that no matter the circumstances, you need to take these preventive measures whenever you are coming in contact with your patient or client. And so, it taught us a lesson that there are conditions or there are instances where you should not overlook anything. Do not leave out universal precautions. Do not leave out these infection prevention control and protocol. It also taught us that even in the process of caring for a patient, you could transfer a disease from one patient to another. So, it taught me a great lesson—",,,Q: —Do you think these habits—,"WF: But what I’m seeing now, it’s going down again. It’s like we are going back to our pre-Ebola stage where infection prevention, where we knew about it, but were not observing it. I’m not in a health facility anymore. I’m with the school. But when I go to the hospital for supervision, the buckets are there, but since when was this water changed? It’s just there. And sometimes in some facilities you don’t even see soap any longer. You don’t see hand sanitizer any longer. We are going back. We are forgetting again. From my own observation, that’s what I’m seeing. ",,,Q: What are the five things or three things that you can tell that you’ve learned about the ,Ebola crisis?,WF:The Ebola crisis taught us a great lesson. And one of the lessons that I learned from that was to always take precautions when you are caring for a client. Do not overlook any case. ,"And another lesson that I was taught was that there should always be materials available because if materials are not available, you are going to put yourself at risk and you will end up dying from preventable diseases. Like we have colleagues who were victims, and these colleagues were caring for patients who they felt that never had this Ebola. Maybe one way or the other, maybe by mistake, they got infected from that patient. So, we should always remember that every case that we interact with remember that you need to continue your IPC protocol.","Another lesson, or one last negative part, is we tend to forget too soon. When things are no more, we feel that all is well. Instead of being proactive, we most of time become retroactive. That is, we know that you need to take your IPC measures at all times. Do not wait for a situation to come before you say, “Oh, let me take IPC measures.” It could be too late. You could be infected already. So, instead of just waiting for Ebola outbreak or another outbreak before we know that we as health workers should take precautions. That, for me, it’s not a good practice for us health workers in Liberia. And we need to learn from that. We need to learn from the Ebola episode.","Whenever I’m giving health education—because most of the time this mentorship program is that you only teach when you meet with your colleague, you mentor them and you teach them—when I’m mentoring them I’m always reminding them that we should not wait for a situation to take action. We should always prepare for it. That is, always observe your IPC measures. So, that’s one lesson that I have learned. And this lesson I have made it my business or my regular practice to always tell my midwives or even other health workers that always observe IPC. Do not leave it out, because we as health workers were victims of being forgetful. That’s how we were highly hit.",Q:  Women were involved in the health education?,"WF: Women were committed. Women were involved. Even the younger girls in the community were involved with the health education, going from house to house educating people.",,Q: And how about the men?,"WF: Men [laughs], the men, too. But mostly you’d see the women and the youth, those younger boys and girls involved going from house to house. They were the community mobilizers informing people about preventive measures. In my community almost every house had this bucket. This Ebola bucket where we had water. You had bleach in the water. When you are entering my house, you have to wash your hands. When you are leaving, you have to wash your hands. Every house had those buckets sitting right at the door.",,,,"Q: In your work, you are working with other nurses from other institutions or organizations, some national and international. How was it to work with them?","WF:It was not difficult to work with them because everyone was working towards one common goal: prevention. Save yourself. This SQS [Safe and Quality Service training] is save first you, your clients, and your family members. So, save all. So, the goal was always use the preventive measure. Do not be the one to transmit the virus to another person. So, we all worked together as one team. Like, even in the facility when we have a case like a pregnant woman comes, everyone showed concern. We would remind each other when we are doing procedures, “Have you done this? Do this. Do this step, do not forget this step.” So, it was like you remind me, I remind you, and we work together to save the life of the client.",,,,Q: Is there anything that could be done differently?,WF: I don’t think there’s anything to be done differently in terms of IPC. But what we need to do is something that we already have the knowledge of. And the knowledge should always be implemented at the facility level. ,"Not only at the facility level but at the community level, because I assume that Liberians have forgotten. Yes, because if a child is sick, as soon as I see my child is sick, another person is coming. “Oh, this child has a fever.” He used his same bare hand to touch the child. So, we have forgotten. Ebola is gone and everything is gone.","But for the health worker—for us, the health practitioner—we should be the ones to continue to remind the community constantly about this IPC protocol. Preventing at your community level, this is what you do to prevent the spread of disease.",Q: And how about the communities themselves? [laughter],"WF: The communities themselves, as I said, community leaders need to also be reminded to continue what they were doing during the Ebola. It’s not only about just since Ebola is gone everything is over and let’s go back to our same business as usual. We should continue to carry out our activity during Ebola and even after Ebola, continue what was done during the Ebola that to helped us fight Ebola. And at the facility level, for us that are in leadership positions, we should make sure to have those materials that will make our health practitioners or our police to carry out these IPC protocols.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n37,Senesie Margao,Senesie,,Margao,Annette Mwansa Nkowane,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,Nurse,Senesie Margao was the President of the Sierra Leone Nurses Association at the time of the Ebola outbreak. He is a graduate of the National School of Nursing. He worked with the Directorate of Nursing and Midwifery Services to conduct trainings and recruit nurses to work during the outbreak.,"Q: It’s nice here, being in Sierra Leone. [laughs] As you heard, we would like you to talk about your experiences in Ebola, and just open up and let us know. It’s something we want to learn from you. I’ll ask you some questions, and then you can tell me—feel free. And it’s being recorded, and so that we don’t miss out anything. When did the outbreak begin?","SM: It was 2014. And we all know it started in Kailahun District, precisely from Koindu. It moved, then, to Kenema, Madisalai, a co-district, then to there around Kenema. Those are the initial areas where we had the outbreak. I was the President of Sierra Leone Nurses Association at the time of the Ebola outbreak. Honestly, it was a challenge for all. And for us as an association, it was also devastating, seeing your colleagues who are service providers succumb to that as a result of their services being provided. ",,,,,"Q: Okay. Well, I just want a little bit about your life history. You know, we all begin from somewhere. [laughs] It’s not because Ebola was there, then it happened, but just a little bit about your life, your family, your education, and why you decided to become a nurse.","SM:  I originally came from a humble background, from Bo, which is like the second city, not within the township of Bo but one of the chiefdoms in Bo District. I was born in a village called Opasama [phonetic], and from a mom by the name of Jeneba [phonetic] Margao and a dad by the name of Mami [phonetic] Margao, a polygamist home with several children. About four wives, several children. From my mom’s side, we are about six in number: three males and then four females. I started my schooling in that same village, Opasama. I did up to class four, [unclear] my older brother, but I do my process in Gomban [phonetic] Sowa, as Pujehun District. ","I was there until I started on my Selective Entrance, which is now called in this country as National Primary School. I start on my entrance there. And I went to a government-subsidized school Jemin [phonetic]. I was there. Then the war broke off, 1991. Definitely that was not good for us. We have to move from Jemin School. I went to St. Edward’s Secondary School, Bo. There I sat for my GCO Level, and then later I started teaching at that same school as a volunteer in the school there, because my father was in the camp, in the—",,,,,Q: Army?,"SM: In a displaced camp in Bo. I had to volunteer at the school to raise money. In 1999, I entered the National School of Nursing to do my RN [Registered Nurse]. And there I rose to the point of getting the student chino president, in the year 2001-2002, academic year. That was my final year at the school. I left….",,,Q: To do volunteer work.,"SM: Do volunteer work for the Association. I was elected Secretary General of the Association in 2004, position I held for up to almost four years. There was an election. I never vied again, because I wanted to pursue other causes. The President called me to come and assist her as the Vice President.",,,,,,,"Q: Okay, so this is the position you are holding.","SM: When the President is not around, the Vice President has to take over. When her time came to an end was elected as the official President—",,,,Q: So who are your mentors in this?,"SM: In the sense of my family, mine, I’m also married with three children. But my mentor within the profession, literally, I have Patricia Va [phonetic]. Yes, the President of the Association, and virtually they did mentor me somehow, because at the beginning it’s a position where you are not paid. It’s a volunteer position, and so most times, people were not willing to even act, because, one, you are not victimized at national level, and simple fear.",,,,,,Q: So you have a good heart. [laughs],"SM: —Yes and I really suffered a lot. Because, you know, in an association you are a middleman between the employers and the employees of the nursing force. You have to be firm in making decisions on behalf of the employees. And most of the time, you know, employers want people who are flexible at times on issues, and so if you are there to bring up challenging issue, most of them, they see you as a bad person. But your role is there to defend, and so I continued defending my colleagues until my time of office ends in May 2019.",,,"Q: What was the first time you got engaged in the Ebola outbreak, or how did you get engaged? And what was it like to take care of the patients, or the clients?","SM: Initially, I was involved in the training. I worked with the Directorate of Nursing and Midwifery Services then, and I also had to work with other parastaters [phonetic] who are also recruiting nurses to work during the Ebola [outbreak]. The outbreak was of course devastating to us as a country, because virtually there was nothing there in the beginning to help fight the disease. We’re talking about four to five functioning ambulances, the whole country. We’re talking about less knowledge because we never had an outbreak, even though we’ve got hemorrhagic fever in this country, the Lhasa fever, but it was nowhere as massive as Ebola; it was nowhere as deadly as Ebola. And so therefore it came to us, as a country, in the form of surprise. The country was not prepared, and so as an organization you are not prepared for that. ","After the outbreak colleagues started succumbing to it, and they would have to raise up an alarm with the government. Then we started losing our colleagues, so therefore certain issues, we took care of, like the equipment to work with. These are very key.",,Q: The equipment.,"SM: The equipment, because for Kenema, our colleagues were using PPE [personal protective equipment]. They didn’t use it off and discard them. Some of them had to keep them, take them to their home, bring it back, so that others cannot use them. Imagine taking that type of infected material to your home, but it’s why a lot of colleagues lose not only themselves as service providers, but all of their families also went down. Because of those things, we had to raise the issue with the government, as an association. We sat with the president and raised some issues in terms of supplying all the necessary materials, and then also giving us an allowance to help motivate colleagues to go there. And allowances were paid based on the level of exposure, and so that’s how it was—",,,,,"Q: How did you come to protect yourself? You said they didn’t have resources in the beginning, and how was that message delivered to the people who are in direct contact?","SM: We visited every district, not once, not twice, but several times, all the districts in this country. And then, due to the escalation, the government had to put Ebola as an emergency, [and the] WHO [World Health Organization] and everyone partnered. We had a lot of support coming into the country. Most of it was training, because we knew very well that we didn’t have the knowledge we needed for Ebola. That caused numerous deaths of our colleagues. But after that training, there was now a drastic reduction in both deaths of service providers within the treatment center, to the bigger team. And so, for us, the training was very important. We had to ensure that as an association we not only work with not only the government but other partners who were in the country to help us in the fight against Ebola.",,"Q: What do you think the composition of health workers—how was it organized, you know, the types? Were there more women? Were there more men?","SM: Well, for nursing, we all are very aware nursing is something like ninety percent to ninety-five percent women. Even when it comes to your support staff at these treatment centers, more women were also employed to ensure that we all fight the deadly virus in our country.",,,,Q: There must have been some losses among the staff because of Ebola. How did you deal with that? How did you help colleagues overcome that?,"SM: As an organization, several times when colleagues were quarantined we were able to supply their materials and food items to their homes [phonetic]. For some of them who lost their lives,  we were able to provide some material things.",,,,"Q: In terms of safety, how did you come to protect yourself? You said they didn’t have resources in the beginning, and how was that message delivered to the people who are in direct contact?","SM: We visited every district, not once, not twice, but several times, all the districts in this country. And then, due to the escalation, the government had to put Ebola as an emergency, [and the] WHO [World Health Organization] came and everyone partnered. So we have a lot of support coming into the country. Most of it was training, because we knew very well that we didn’t have the knowledge we needed for Ebola. That caused numerous deaths in our colleagues. But after that training, there was a drastic reduction in deaths of service providers within the treatment center.",,,"Q: What do you think the composition of health workers—how was it organized, you know, the types? Were there more women? Were there more men?","SM: Well, for nursing, we all are very aware nursing is something like ninety percent to ninety-five percent women. Even when it comes to your support staff at these treatment centers, more women were also employed. ",,"Q: What stands out for you in terms of what you learned? You know, because there are old habits, new habits. What stands out?","SM: Our healthcare system in the country, as a country. Things were not there. And the training. Training, training, training. Most of us are never trained in some of those basic things, in terms of infection prevention and control. After Ebola, the Ministry of Health ensured that every health provider has been trained not once, not twice, some of them thrice in infection prevention and control. But, like, as I said, this was lacking at the initial phase of the outbreak.",,"Q: How was your interaction and communication between you and the doctors, the nursing professional?","SM: I don’t know about other countries but, like, for Sierra Leone, the doctors weren’t always best for them. Nurses would do all the dirty jobs.",,,"Q: We want to learn from this situation. What were the most important things that you learned, that the health workers should be able to remember?","SM: Okay. First, you always have to be knowledgeable enough. That was one. And then also teamwork was also necessary in terms of preventing Ebola. Teamwork was key. Community participation was also very important, because we, as health workers and individuals, really need the involvement of community people, in terms of the bylaws that were done by this community of people, together with government authorities. Let’s say law enforcement also was very key in fighting off Ebola in this country.",,,Q: What do you mean by that?,"SM: One, there was a law issued: don’t touch a sick person. You should not touch a dead body. Those things were enforced. Initial phase, people never listened. They are washing the body without a tool. They don’t have gloves. They use their bare hands. You have to wash that person and wrap that person for burial. Imagine. And one knew very well once the individual was dead from Ebola [that] the body itself was going to be billions of the virus encapsulated. The mere touch of it gets yourself infected. In one village, people were even using the water to drink. So that village, almost all of them died. To me, that’s—we want in Africa the law, the enforcement of the law, the community involvement through sensitization, using different media. It was very helpful. ","Community ambassadors were trained. They were sensitized, using posters, using radio, some of them using other means within the community, just to ensure that they are also aware of Ebola to make for them also to see the need. That’s to protect themselves as a community. Because even the institution of communion, greetings after service, all these things were put to a stop by the government, by the religious council. ","Q: How about the community, and the global community, in terms of preparedness? ","SM: Well, to me, the international community, my own advice to them is, one, since most of the African countries did not regain their economy [phonetic], they have to ensure to continue engaging the government on those issues, because when it affects one nation, there’s tendency to spread to the other nations. That’s part of what WHO is doing in Sierra Leone, what ICAP [International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Programs] is doing. They’re coming over, supporting people in training, building the capacity. They also need to be reminding governments. They have to also strengthen secondary institutions. Because most of them concentrate on the primary preventative aspect. The curative aspect, the people there don’t have the requisite knowledge in terms of prevention, so they really need to strengthen those. And they also need to strengthen their engagements with the government, because that is very key. ",,"Q: What are you most proud of, after going through this—","SM: Ebola. One thing, we were able as a country—I’m proud that we are able as a country, together with partners, to win over Ebola. You cannot lead in silence. You need support. You have to work with others. No one person can do it alone. And then, in terms of outbreak, my plea with the international partners, not to wait until after people have succumbed to death, before they come in. And they should, because they knew about Ebola in other countries. They knew it’s a devastating condition. But they left us for some time. So I think early intervention, if a disease, they know that it has caused massive destruction or massive loss of death in other countries, once you hear that this one has occurred in a country, I think the international partners need to get in quick to see how best they can—instead of relying on the existing government, when they know very well the capacity is not there to be able to fight that disease. That should be something they also need to look into as international partners: early intervention in an outbreak, diseases that have occurred in other countries that have caused massive, massive deaths.",,"Q: At what point in time was there a turning in terms of the control of the virus? The virus reached a peak, and happened when there was a turnaround that cases are going down?","SM: There was a turning point within the outbreak in terms of education. That was very key, because the awareness was high, in terms of infection prevention and control. They also had massive partners convening. Because of that, I think there was a reversing. Awareness was very, very high. And because awareness was high, there was a reversal.",,,,,"Q: What has changed you, what has impacted you most, and made you better, or not a better person, [laughs] after Ebola?","SM: Yes, one thing I learned from Ebola, which I believe has helped me a lot, was teamwork. Teamwork was really nice. That’s one good aspect of it. And the other one, it also helped build my capacity, in terms of leadership. I interacted with several other authorities, both local and international, which also helped. And then, thirdly, my colleagues, also, were able to have the requisite experience in terms of care in our country.",,,,,,,,,
n38,Constance T. Lumeh,Constance,T,Lumeh,Jennifer Dohrn,16-Aug-19,Monrovia,Liberia,Nurse and midwife,"Constance T. Lumeh is a nurse and midwife in the OB/GYN ward at Redemption Hospital. During the Ebola outbreak, Lumeh treated patients in an Ebola Treatment Unit at Redemption Hospital and conducted outreach in her community to encourage people to get tested. ","Q: Why did you become a nurse and midwife? What made you, growing up, decide to do this?","CTL: I wanted to be a nurse, but I decided to do midwifery first as a stepping-stone, and after practicing, went back to school to do the RN [registered nurse]. And presently, I’m RNCM. ",,,,,Q: Where did you grow up? Can you tell me a little bit about the community that you grew up in?,"CTL: I grew up in Montserrado. I lived with both parents. I came from a Muslim background. I have one sister, two brothers. I am the last. Presently, I’m married. I have one child.",,,,,,"Q: One child. Congratulations. Where did you get encouragement that you as a young girl, becoming a woman, could do what you’re currently doing?","CTL: I was about eight. My mother’s younger sister was a nurse midwife. She had a shop where she used to sit after work treating the babies. I would visit her there. By the age of ten or eleven I acted as if doing what she did was my intention. I adore babies. That’s where I have my passion. And from there I grew up, but just prior to the war, things changed. I really wanted to become a medical doctor, but unfortunately, when I took the test to go to school, there was no money. We were heartbroken.",,,"Q: Constance, can you tell me when you first heard the words Ebola viral disease? ","Lumeh: My experience of it is 2014, 2014 June to July mainly.",,,,,,,Q: And what happened then in that time?,CLT: Everyone was afraid. People were running away from jobs.  It was not easy. ,,,,Q: So who taught you how to protect yourself? How did you learn that?,"CLT: WHO [World Health Organization] would send people to teach how to wear the PPE, how to take it off, how to spray. All the people started listening to them. It really helped because you could get infected taking off the material. ",,,,,,"Q: Can you talk a little bit about how—what is—tell me about the tradition of how people are buried here in Liberia, before Ebola. What happens when someone dies? What does the family do?","CLT: Before Ebola, if somebody from my religion died you have to bathe the person. Then what they’re supposed to do is turn to other people to bury them. We will come, have ceremonials, lots of things. Then at the end, we cook food or eat together. That used to happen prior to Ebola. And even initially when Ebola entered, they were still doing it because it was like a denial stage. Everyone was saying they’re lying. They take money from people. They want to bring diseases. Just lying. ",,,"Q: So how did Ebola change this?  It stopped what you normally did, right, the epidemic? You couldn’t bury people in the way that you had before.","CLT: When the Ebola came, after a time, they decided to burn people. They used to burn people. ",,,Q: Did many nurses die?,"CLT: From our facility, yes, died. We lost four doctors in one team.",,,,,Q: Did you think you were going to die?,"CLT: Did I think that I was going to die? Yes. Just like in the morning before you go, you have to pray. You enter. You pray. But just everybody wanted to pray first for themselves. You come home, your wash your skin with triple antibiotic. No places are safe.",,"Q: What did you learn the most about what worked, what were good things that nurses could do, and what you would have liked more of? To prepare for another epidemic, right—","CLT: And I pray for it. But if, yes.",,,,"Q: Yes. What do you want for nurses? What would you want to say to nurses in another country, or facing an epidemic? What would you tell them? What would you advise them to do?",CLT: The best people to fight the epidemic are from your country because you ,"have knowledge of your system. If you are not from that country some people will not trust you, “I’m from Togo, not from Liberia”.  But you do what you do because you are there to save humanity. Nurses, they’re saving humanity. That’s my passion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n39,Isatu Kamara,Isatu,,Kamara,Susan Michaels-Strasser,12-Aug-19,Freetown,Sierra Leone,Senior Matron of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation,"Isatu Kamara is the senior matron of Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health and Sanitation. During the Ebola epidemic, she coordinated the Ebola holding unit at Connaught Teaching Hospital. She is a state-registered nurse and has a masters in public administration.",Q: What was your position during the Ebola epidemic?,"IK: I’m a senior matron, Ministry of Health and Sanitation, and I was coordinating the Ebola holding cell, holding unit, at Connaught Hospital. I’m a nurse by profession.",,,,,Q: What were you doing during the Ebola outbreak? ,"IK: In Freetown after the training, we decided to establish an isolation unit and found two rooms in the outpatient section of the hospital that we used to isolate patients. ","We started. Our first victim of Ebola was in May 29, 2014, an Egyptian who was a doctor working at one of the Arab clinics. At that time the patient was brought to a facility and we isolated him. There was also rash, no hand-washing hygiene and only a few of us had [prior] knowledge of what a hemorrhagic fever should look like.","Patients started coming. Suspected cases. The seven beds were not enough. We decided to extend it to twelve. Still it was not enough, because it was the first holding center for the Western Area. And we expanded it to twenty-one. One of the committed nurses came to my office and said, “Matron, you are our boss, we cannot sit down and allow you to go into that place doing all the work,” so some of them decided to join me. They were trained by King’s. ","Since some of the patients were so weak that they were not able to walk, we organized a bucket system and trained hygienists. They would clean the patients and take the rubbish to the incinerator. We decided to have surveillance officers, advocates to look for symptoms and then we set up the criteria: fever above thirty-eight degrees centigrade, redness of the eyes, sore throat, cough, bleeding gums, vomiting of blood, cough, rash, diarrhea, and then difficulty breathing, and so forth.","We started treating some of these cases symptomatically: for fever we give analgesic, for diarrhea oral rehydration salts, and then antibiotics like ceftriaxone. Vitamins. Antimalarials. And encourage them to take fluids. We lost about twelve of our staff, four doctors, eight nurses, two hygienists, one of our maintenance officers. And a finance officer.",,Q: Thank you. This is very powerful. Can you tell me a bit about becoming a nurse? How that began and how that led up to where you were at Connaught?,"IK: I was born in a village called Malikenkambia district. My father was a courts messenger and my mother a farmer. I came from a polygamous family, twenty-five in number; my mother was my father’s first wife. In 1974, we came to Freetown, and I started school. I passed with flying colors. I entered the School of Nursing in 1983 and graduated in 1986 as a state-registered nurse. I have worked around the country. I have attended several courses in Africa, in Asia, in South America. I’m also an administrator. I entered University of Makeni in 2006 and graduated in 2010 with a BS in human resource management. Then I went to the school of public health in Ghana and earned a certificate in epidemiology and health system management. I did sexual and reproductive health and family planning. I have a certificate for that and as a trainer for Ebola. In 2017, I graduated with a master’s degree in public administration. I’ve been a nurse for the past thirty years.",,,"Q: You shared a very vivid story about the period of time that you worked between April and November of 2014. And the lead-up of that, how you became a nurse. What kept you going? You talked a lot about stigma, about people dying, colleagues dying. What kept you going?","IK: Well, I had a passion for nursing. I think my greatest opportunity is here because not all of us will leave the shores of Sierra Leone. Some of us have to serve, we are committed to serve our people. And I think one of the keys to success is hard work, humility, integrity, and a passion for people.",,,,,,,Q: Can you talk a little bit more about that passion for people?,"IK: Well, since I was a little girl my father had a keen interest in nursing. He said that I should become a nurse. I decided to listen to the words of my late father. I decided to become a nurse because I have passion for people.",,,,"Q: Do you think he saw something in you, your father?","IK: Well, my father Muslim, so I think that humility stems from my father.",,,,,,Q: At one point there was a lockdown? What did that include?,"IK: Well, for the lockdown, community members were involved. They were told to go out and look within their communities for suspected cases. At the Ministry of Health, ambulances were dispatched. They saw a lot of suspected cases. Some of them tested positive and were transferred to treatment centers. During the lockdown, more holding centers and treatment centers were established.",,,"Q: It sounds like that first period, April to September, was very different from September, October onwards. Those first few months were very different from those latter months.","IK: Yes, because the public health emergency issued a public notice that nobody should travel to the other regions. You should stay where you are. And for public transport, there should be no overcrowding. Because some were taking six per car. They reduced it to four. And for the bigger transports they reduced the overcrowding. And then there should be no market days on Sundays.",,,Q: And when was that started?,"IK: In August. At the peak of the epidemic people were disallowed to eat bushmeat, and handwashing buckets were set up in all establishments: whenever you go to the bank, you go to the public value schools, you have to wash your hands when you enter, when you are coming out you wash your hands. It was one of the protocols. And hand sanitizers were shared all over the place.",,,,,"Q:  Once people saw survivors, can you describe what then started to happen? ","IK: Luckily some of the survivors were nurses, and they started working in the units, immediately they were much better, recovered. They joined the team. And so that was a sense of relief and hope to the other patients. ",,"Q: You use the word hope. Can you talk about that a bit more? Amongst the nurses, what did you see when you said there became hope?","IK: Hope, because for me to be able to survive over eighteen months working with Ebola and not acquire the disease, it was a big hope for some of the nurses. Because you’re constantly telling them that whenever you enter the unit do the right thing. Handwashing. That is one of the keys to success. Wash your hands frequently. Don’t touch, wash your hands. Wherever you are, wash your hands. Use sanitizer. But handwashing I think is the best.",,,,"Q: You spoke a lot about your experiences right at the front line with patients, with your family, with community. Can you describe how you emerged as a leader?","IK: Well, I think one of my habits is to exert influence on my nurses.",,,,Q: Influence?,"IK: Yes. Because when you mentor you have followers. When you lead others will follow. And as an exemplar leader, you have integrity, they have faith in you. You are relying, you are responsible, and there is dignity and respect for your colleague. So you are able to lead. And then they appreciate the recognition. You recognize them for their good work. You encourage them.",,,Q: Where do you think that came from? Your leadership qualities. Where did that come from in you?,"IK: I think a background in management helped me a lot. Because managing people in an organization, you have to look at their behavior, positive behavior, negative behavior. You have the good eggs and the bad eggs. You use the good nurses as change agents. You dialogue with them, you manipulate them, you give and take. And correction should be a last resort. I don’t think that correction should play a role in leadership.","You encourage them, you listen, you have to be a good listener. You pick out the good things and use them, you see. Communication. Effective communication. Let them talk.",Q: Sometimes being a leader is lonely. Lonely. Who was around you supporting you?,"IK: Well, I have my senior nurses. I’m not a perfectionist, I have my own weaknesses. Some of them would say I like to shout, but within a few minutes it’s all over. The next day, even if you don’t talk to me, I’ll go to you. I will meet you. Being a leader, you have to be submissive.",,Q: Incredible. What is your proudest moment throughout this experience?,"IK: I thank God for serving me through this ordeal, because I’m not better than my colleagues who died during the epidemic. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
