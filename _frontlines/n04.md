title: Nurse Midwife; Directorate of Training, Human Resources Department, Sierra
  Leone Ministry of Health
biography: Elizabeth Lemor has worked as a nurse midwife since 1990. During the Ebola
  epidemic, Lemor worked for the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health in the Human Resource
  Department of the Attendance Monitoring Bureau. Previously, Lemor had worked at
  Ola During Children's Hospital and Kenema Government Hospital.
Q_1: 'Q: Where were you working during the Ebola crisis? How did you become a nurse?'
A_1a: 'EKL: I was working for the Human Resource Department at the Attendance Monitoring
  Unit, Bureau Unit. A friend told me that there was a school offering nursing school
  almost for free and would also give you lodging. I enrolled to do SRN [State Registered
  Nurse] in 1987. When I graduated in 1989, I was posted to the Ola During Children’s
  Hospital, and I went for midwifery training. '
A_1b: After the midwifery, I was reposted to Children’s Hospital, and I brought my
  son to be with me. We relocated to Kenema, and that was when the Rebel War became
  intensified around the surroundings of Kenema and even in Kenema. By then, life
  was not really easy. Seeing the people displaced that came back. All my mother’s
  family members were staying with us in the same house, so the meager resources we
  were getting were not enough to take care of the people around us. We had to make
  do with whatever was available. 
A_1c: I was working in Kenema Government Hospital and was assigned to one of the wards
  that the wounded soldiers were admitted to. It was really stressful because every
  day they would bring somebody that had been injured, or somebody that had been killed
  in the war.

Q_2: 'Q: When did you learn about Ebola, and what was your experience?'
A_2a: 'EKL: I think Ebola came in March 2013 or so, and I went on a monitoring tour
  in Kenema. That was when I heard that a fever was killing people in Kailahun, and
  we thought it was Lhasa, it will pass. When I came back to Freetown, I heard the
  news that it wasn’t Lhasa, it was Ebola. But before it was declared Ebola, we gave
  it all sorts of names. We knew the Ministry was preparing for some kind of epidemic.
  But health workers were thinking, it’s fever, it’s headache, and other complications
  of malaria, so maybe it’s malaria. Nobody thought it was its own thing. '
A_2b: The first case came from Kailahun to Kenema, where many health workers had been
  infected and some had died. In Kenema, I got involved with Ebola when one of the
  health workers came to the office for an inter-district transfer. He wanted an annual
  leave, because he thought it was time. I told him, “You know, they say it’s Ebola,
  so can you please stand off my table so that we can talk? You don’t need to be so
  close to me.” And he said, “Sister, I’m not from where the Ebola is.” I said, “I
  know, but we have to start to keep precaution and other things.”
A_2c: He laughed and left for Cameroon. Then the message came that they were looking
  for him, that he was one of the suspects they are looking for. He was captured in
  Cameroon and taken back to Kenema, into the ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit]. We had been
  thinking that Ebola was far off. Then we knew that Ebola could easily come to Freetown. 
A_2d: The news about colleagues falling down with Ebola, getting ill, came. Many nurses
  had died. Even in Kenema, the population was rejecting health workers because they
  were thought to be lying. They were accused of saying “it’s Ebola,” but when people
  came for treatment, they would inject them and make them die. The health workers
  started leaving the workplace because of the stigmas and everything attached to
  them.

Q_3: 'Q: What was the proudest thing you did? You know, if you look back and say,
  oh, but even in this confusion I did something.'
A_3a: 'EKL: The proudest thing I did was participating in the training. When we were
  developing the models for treatment, people from WHO would insist that we not touch
  the patient, that you should keep an arm’s-length distance between you and the patient.
  I said, “Then why are we bringing them into hospitals? Because if we are not going
  to touch them and we are protecting ourselves, the one thing that is always critical
  in nursing care is that in nursing you touch. We should devise a way so that even
  if you touch you are protected.” '
A_3b: There is no human who is going to come close to the other who will not touch,
  and we had the culture of touching. That was how we changed most of the protocols
  to adapt to our cultural settings, where at least you will not go and see a patient
  struggling and not help. At least you will take water and give it to the person
  to drink, and not leave the person to say, “Get up and take water,” because if you
  are really sick you will not even get up to take water.  With us there was someone
  who would take it and give it to you to drink.
3c: We had to cry out for nurses to say, “Listen, this is not right. Even the protective
  gear isn’t enough.” They were listening to me, to us, even during the lockdown.
  We participated in the lockdown, we visited people and assisted. Those are the things
  we are proud of that we did as a country. At least we joined hands to fight Ebola.
Q_4: 'Q: So what can you tell us in terms of what you’ve experienced? What lessons
  have you learned, and what advice can you give if there’s another outbreak? How
  do you think we should be ready for that?'
A_4a: 'EKL: We need to strengthen the health system, but even the strengthening that
  Sierra Leone did was not enough, because when you strengthen the health system,
  for most of our colleagues or most of us working,…we don’t have the equipment and
  the facility to work in. And working in this part of the country as a nurse is the
  most deplorable [phonetic] profession in healthcare that you can go into, because
  nursing can be the least recognized profession in healthcare in Sierra Leone now.'
