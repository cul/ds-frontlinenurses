title: Former Regional Advisor for Nursing and Midwifery, WHO AFRO
biography: Margaret Loma Phiri is a nurse midwife from Malawi. Phiri is currently
  a nursing advisor for Seed Global Health. Previously, Phiri worked as a regional
  advisor for nursing and midwifery at WHO AFRO. In 2015, Phiri went to Sierra Leone
  on behalf of the WHO to work on strengthening maternal and newborn health in that
  country during the Ebola epidemic. Phiri is a nurse educator with a masters in education
  and taught for many years at the Blantyre School of Nursing at the University of
  Malawi. As part of Columbia University's On the Frontlines project, Phiri conducted
  interviews with Ebola nurses in Sierra Leone and Liberia in August 2019.
Q_1: 'Q: Can I ask you: when was the first time you heard of Ebola?'
A_1a: 'MLP: The first time I really heard of Ebola was the time when there was Ebola
  in Sierra Leone. I had never heard about it before. And as a matter of fact, when
  I was asked to go to Sierra Leone I was a bit scared, because I really didn’t know
  what it was all about, and the risks that one would take, that I was taking, to
  come into the country which had just gone through and was still going through that
  epidemic.'

Q_2: 'Q: Later, when you returned to Sierra Leone after your holiday trip to Malawi,
  were there nurses who had died from Ebola that you had known?'
A_2a: 'MLP: Most of them I didn’t know then, but one thing I learned was that actually
  most of them who died were really the frontline nurses, the second level, the enrolled
  nurses who really do provide bedside care. Those were the ones that died, in majority,
  and, of course, some of the doctors, too. And we had the opportunity to visit the
  hospital where the Ebola started, in Kenema, where they have a statue for all those
  who died, so you can read their names. They are there.'

Q_3: 'Q: Who did the statue? Who put up the statue?'
A_3a: 'MLP: I think it was put up by the government itself, Ministry of Health. '

Q_4: 'Q: There were that many nurses that had died.'
A_4a: 'MLP: Yes, the number was about 222, although some think that maybe some were
  not recorded. And most of those were recorded were the ones maybe who were officially
  employees of the Ministry. Very sad story. Sad. Sad in the sense that nursing lies
  in caring for people, and if you can’t care you’re not doing anything. And then
  if in the process of caring you become a victim yourself, then it’s really a different,
  tragic story. And it was, I think, because of that that one of the priorities during
  the—when the epidemic had just started, and even in the course of recovery, was
  how can we make sure that people, especially providers themselves, are protected.
  How do we do that? And that was one of the key interventions in the process of managing
  the Ebola itself.'

Q_5: 'Q: So then with Ebola, the outbreak and the rapid spread around, what was your
  sense of how communities saw nurses during Ebola time?'
A_5a: 'MLP: Communities saw nurses, on average, as their sources of hope, in the sense
  that you see you have this group, which you will call state-enrolled community health
  nurses, and that group works right in the communities, so they are really part of
  the entry point into the normal or formal healthcare system. And that’s why most
  of them, it’s that category that died, because of their closeness, one, to the communities,
  and also really working as formal frontline health workers. I think the nurses did
  a great job in terms of providing the care and the information, the health education,
  community awareness-raising about the disease, as the group that is closest to them.'
A_5b: In addition to that, in Sierra Leone, nurses form more than seventy percent
  of the healthcare workers. They’re the majority, so every program you go through,
  they’re the people that are literally manning the interventions. What I’m trying
  to say here is that the community relied on the support from this group, right at
  an entry level point in terms of if they were sick or whatever, those were the people
  that actually provided the first line of care.

Q_6: 'Q: In looking at what were the lessons learned and where to go forward, maybe
  you could talk about that a little more from the perspective of nursing. What were
  missed opportunities to not have nurses at leadership, or were there—in structuring
  a response and then going forward? What do you think, looking back at this? You
  said some things you think were really important changes.'
A_6a: 'MLP: Having appropriate knowledge and skills is key. So is putting in place
  communication systems for proper coordination. Thirdly, availability of the required
  resources: drugs, utensils, PPEs -- appropriate ones, not ad hoc. And fourthly,
  really giving recognition to people when they’re doing such a great job, because
  it was a risk, a real risk for those who helped and still survived. I think they
  need to be thanked or recognized professionally, to say, “You made a difference
  in the lives of people.” The last is to promote working as a team, because no single
  professional group can solve all the problems, and I think the nurses dutifully
  recognized that. They didn’t think to say because we’re in charge then we can work
  just on our own. No, they did everything involving the communities, the patients
  themselves, telling a story to say, “You know what? We feel bad about the patients
  themselves, because of the restrictions of infection prevention.” These people still
  needed to be seen by their relatives, just to say hello. And they devised means
  on how they can still communicate, and allow them even to pray, which I thought
  was, wow, yes. Those were some of the things that give hope to patients, yes, that
  they still felt, oh, not all is lost. So putting in some of these human touches,
  things that may not be prescribed in the book, but that show, as people, what do
  you stand for?'
