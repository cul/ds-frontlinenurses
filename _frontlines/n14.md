title: Former Technical Officer of Nursing and Midwifery, WHO Human Resources for
  Health
biography: Annette Mwansa Nkowane is a nurse midwife from Zambia. During the Ebola
  outbreak, Nkowane served as the Technical Officer of Nursing and Midwifery in the
  World Health Organization's Health Workforce Department. Previously, she worked
  with other WHO departments including Mental Health and Substance Dependence and
  Gender and Women's Health. Nkowane trained as a community health nurse before completing
  a masters in human resource development. Prior to her position at the WHO, Nkowane
  worked with International Federation of the Red Cross on developing community-based
  first aid. As part of Columbia University's On the Frontlines project, Nkowane conducted
  interviews with Ebola nurses in Sierra Leone and Liberia in August 2019.
Q_1: 'Q: Will you tell me your name and what job you’ve held around nursing, your
  orientation?'
A_1a: 'AMN: I am Zambian. I’m a nurse, a midwife as well a community health nurse.
  After I qualified as a registered nurse in Zambia, I worked in Zambia at different
  levels, at the provincial level, community and district levels. I was involved in
  communities a lot, working with the traditional birth attendants, community health
  workers.  Later, I was able to sit for the State Board exams and started working
  as a registered nurse in the state of Georgia and later in the state of Illinois.'
A_1b: Once I got my degree in Nursing, I joined my husband Dr. Nkowane who had been
  offered a job in Geneva with the World Health Organization, to start an AIDS program,
  because in the ’80s, HIV infections were beginning to take hold.

Q_2: 'Q: I would like to ask you to tell me when you first heard about Ebola.'
A_2a: 'AMN: I can’t remember exactly which year, but when it first happened in Uganda. 
  By November 2014, it became apparent that this was not going anywhere.  I was attached
  to the Ebola Technical group.  We mobilized nurses to participate in the Ebola response,
  because WHO really cannot employ so many people, we rely on our partners.  There
  were no standards at that time. For example, one cannot just say a nurse should
  spend five minutes with an Ebola patient. More details are needed to offer the best
  option such as, where is this patient located? Has he or she just been admitted,
  or are they under treatment? How long does it take for a nurse to put on the PPE?
  All those things had to be taken into consideration.  And I think the first even
  statement by WHO was in August, and it was already then shocking everyone.'
A_2b: I think the nursing and midwifery leadership, had certain expectations, and
  did not understand WHO. WHO is not a lobbyist organization; it’s a technical organization.
  As a technical officer—the focus is on improving nursing and midwifery services
  in all health disciplines and not to act as lobbyist for the nursing and midwifery
  profession only. Because of this misconception, the nursing and midwifery community
  would feel that there was nothing being done in WHO, while inside WHO it was clear
  what was being done on nursing and midwifery. It is important that the nursing and
  midwifery leaders understand how WHO functions. In that way all could work better
  to improve the nursing and midwifery profession as a whole. For example, instead
  of pushing for one nurse in the organization they would encourage more nurses and
  midwives to join WHO in all its priority programs such as malaria and TB and all
  that. Then they would have a better chance of influencing health strategies and
  policies affecting nursing and midwifery. One person cannot do it by themselves.
  That’s what I think.

Q_3: 'Q: So here you are, five years later, actually in two countries, talking to
  nurses and midwives at all levels, from Ministry of Health to nurses in the Ebola
  treatment unit. What have you been thinking about and reflecting on? '
A_3a: 'AMN: You know, nursing is a hands-on profession, and you never lose it, and
  somehow, even when I was in Geneva I was thinking, oh, I miss holding a baby, or
  I miss being at the bedside. But, of course, the roles evolve as you progress in
  your professional life. This opportunity here for me is like being closer to what
  I began to do as a nurse, being in touch with people, because in nursing, you have
  to be a people person. And really relating to people on common ground, and listening
  to what they go through, it’s really very emotional for me, it’s like going full
  circle, [laughs] as you are saying. Now we are back on the ground. Let’s see what
  we can do to help nurses, with that knowledge. When I’m talking to nurses and nurse
  leaders, I’m hearing them talking about protocols, those protocols we developed
  in Geneva, that they were being used, they were so helpful for them.'
A_3b: But I also feel sad because protocols only do not help much. It’s really how
  nurses respond, in terms of the support they get. Protocols will not heal the emotional
  wounds.  How do we make sure that, nurses on the frontline come out with less scars
  and continue serving? I see the emotions in the nurses we are talking to. They are
  willing to continue to serve as nurses, but are we supporting them enough for them
  to continue doing their work effectively? That is a question that I have to answer,
  and see how else we can mobilize resources in terms of support, as well as from
  their own governments to continue supporting them.

Q_4: 'Q: So what have you identified as some major challenges, and what would you
  want to do next? '
A_4a: 'AMN: There is need to look at individual nurses as persons, as individuals,
  because they have emotions, they have families. For us to keep them motivated, what
  policies can be put in place that really address their personal aspects? For example,
  we have to look at how they were working. Some of them worked so hard, they never
  rested. What policies can be put in place to ensure that they have some rest? They
  never saw their families. Is there a way that they can continue being in touch with
  their families? They shed tears, when they talk about having to be away from their
  families. Some of them had small children, like two to four years old. They never
  saw them in a long time. That is traumatic for a mother, not to be with their child.
  How else can our governments and organizations help to ensure such family interaction
  happen, while even controlling the risk of infection? At a personal level, there
  has to be something that really heals the wounds, or helps them to keep in touch
  with their families so that they are less stressed, less worried about what is happening
  at home. Although personal protection from infection succeeded, it’s that emotional
  part that needs to be resolved through appropriate policies and support.'
A_4b: 'There is also the issue of management.  Most of these nurses were really running
  the Ebola units. Management skills comes with a lot of aspects: issues of communication;
  conflict management; role definitions; assertiveness; being a leader. A program
  that addresses leadership skills, leadership and management skills for nurses would
  be important. Training shouldn’t happen once or as a one-off thing, it should be
  embedded in an in-service program with nurses enrolled from various levels. We always
  think that management and leadership is only necessary at a higher level. It’s not
  only at higher level; it should be at every level of nursing to some extent. '
A_4c: Information gathering on Ebola is also very important. Nurses are supposed to
  record accurately, get information, relate it to others so that they know what is
  happening and how to respond. People say, “Oh, it’s research. It should not be for
  nurses.”  But when a nurse sees something at the center, if it is recorded and reported
  quickly, cases of Ebola would be identified earlier. So these aspects in the training
  curriculum should be strengthened. 
A_4d: Lastly there are issues of advocacy, to sustain the momentum, especially with
  government. The Ebola outbreak took place, they resolved it, they moved on. But
  nurses and leaders in nursing associations, in the government institutions can continue
  with the advocacy at that level, to keep the momentum and remind populations that
  Ebola outbreak can happen again. They should make sure that disaster preparedness
  is instituted. If they can work on that, then they will be better prepared to respond
  next time should there be another Ebola crisis.
