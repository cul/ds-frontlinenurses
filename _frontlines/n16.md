title: President, Liberian Nurses Association
biography: Gloria Steven is the President of the Liberian Nurses Association. During
  the Ebola epidemic, Severs and her team provided training and supplies to frontline
  nurses.
Q_1: 'Q: What you were doing during the Ebola outbreak?'
A_1a: 'GS: I’m the president for the Liberian Nurses Association. During the Ebola
  crisis, we did training, did a lot of training for the nurses and for people in
  the community, teaching how do to handwashing, how to prepare handwashing fluid.
  We also did some triage training, in one of the counties, to help us to create a
  triaging unit. '

Q_2: 'Q: What did you learn through this crisis?'
A_2a: 'GS: If we had just sat down and we had done nothing, we wouldn’t have gotten
  anywhere. The community was complaining, “We don’t have this. We don’t have PPE
  [personal protective equipment]. We don’t have gloves.” You can’t tell somebody
  to “Wash these decks,” for instance, and you don’t give the person soap, you don’t
  give the person water. How will they wash it? So. We are the ones who try to fend
  for these people, who are actually in the field doing the work. If things are provided,
  people can be able to carry out the work.  We were nursing leaders, nursing advocates.'
A_2b: Those are our responsibilities. But funding is a problem. We have no real source
  of funding from anywhere, besides what nurses pay for their membership.  Whatever
  they pay for the membership card is our only source of funding, no other source,
  nobody else helping us with anything. We got to run this place with just that.

Q_3: 'Q: What are you most proud of?'
A_3a: 'GS: Well—what makes me proud is we have chosen a profession, a profession where
  we save lives. When you have a patient who comes in very sick and you treat that
  patient and that patient can come through and walk out of the hospital, it’s a source
  of pride for you, that you have done something for that patient to recover. '

Q_4: 'Q: Today now, in 2019, have you seen a change in how the health system supports
  nurses? Is there a change that you see? Has nursing changed?'
A_4a: 'GS: There should be shared standards for public and private facilities. Some
  of the private areas don’t want to send their staff for the trainings. The training
  will be there but they won’t send them.  If we have trainings for everybody, it
  should be standard. It shouldn’t be something that, because it’s public, then it’s
  one and, because it’s private, it’s something else. The government needs to think
  on how they can standardize salaries as well. If you have a BSc degree in nursing—everybody
  who obtains that BSc should get that same kind of salary.'
A_4b: Nursing practices and precautions need to be standard as well.  During Ebola,
  we had an IPC [infection protection and control] focal person in certain areas.
  Let that be a standard, so that people can continue to do it, even without the crisis,
  so that, when another crisis comes, you’ll already be prepared. Community engagement
  also needs to continue. The community is where people come from, before they come
  to the hospital. If you have things that were put into place during the crisis,
  they should continue to have them in place in preparation. Like handwashing.
