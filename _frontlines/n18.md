title: Registered Nurse, E.S. Grant Mental Health Hospital and ELWA Hospital
biography: James Harries is a registered nurse currently splitting his time between
  the E.S. Grant Mental Health Hospital and ELWA Hospital, both in Monrovia, Liberia.
  Harries was part of the team at ELWA which treated some of the earliest Ebola patients
  seen in Monrovia. Later, Harries was hired by Médecins Sans Frontières Belgium to
  serve in its Ebola treatment unit.
Q_1: 'Q: In 2014, can you tell me where you were working, what your role was during
  the Ebola outbreak?'
A_1a: 'JH: In 2014, I was working with ELWA Hospital. I was playing a nursing role.
  Then later on, we were trained—after we heard about Ebola—we heard about Ebola in
  Lofa County [Liberia]. Then the management of the institution decided to train all
  of the nurses. ELWA was the first hospital to establish an ETU [Ebola treatment
  unit]. '

Q_2: 'Q: And your role?'
A_2a: 'JH: I received a call over the weekend from my supervisor, that I needed to
  make myself available to work, along with all of our doctors. This was not an easy
  thing. That Saturday morning, when I went to work, Dr. Deddi checked on the schedule
  and said: “Harries, you’re the lead nurse. You need to get set, so we can go in.”
  My heart started beating. Then she went to dress. Then I went to dress. When I got
  to dressing, I decided to pray. When I got through praying, we started to form a
  line to go in. We received all of the instruction, those things that we needed to
  do when we get in. So—'

Q_3: 'Q: —when you got there that day and were told, “You have to go in,” what you
  meant by going in is putting on the full PPE [personal protective equipment]—'
A_3a: JH:  Yes.

Q_4: 'Q: —and going into a red zone.'
A_4a: JH:  Yes. Dr. Deddi decided to lead a team. Right after Deddi should have been
  the nurse. Right after the nurse should have been the aide. But right after Dr.
  Deddi, I decided to stay at the back and give chance to the aide. And aide was in
  front of me. When we got in, we began to talk. Then what really motivated me—when
  I saw Dr. Deddi giving aid to the first Ebola patient that we receive in Monrovia.
  I got motivated.

Q_5: 'Q: What more did you do there?'
A_5a: 'JH: I decided to apply to Belgian MSF. They took me. And I started playing
  both a nursing and a mental health role. When I enter the ETU, if I see somebody
  having frequent bowel movement, I report the case immediately. Those who are depressed,
  I give them psychosocial counseling. '

Q_6: 'Q: So with the mental health services, you were sitting and talking with patients?
  Are there any patients or experiences from providing that psychosocial support that
  stand out in your memory?'
A_6a: 'JH: Yes. I interacted with a patient. She died. She was six months pregnant.
  We got to talking on my first shift. She and I are from the same ethnic group. I
  told her if there is any problem she’s having, she should wait for me because we
  go in three times a day. When I got through talking with her, I came outside. The
  following day, I was on first shift. But when I went to meet her, she was already
  dead.'

Q_7: 'Q: I’m sorry. What helped you—your mental health—what helped you to keep going?
  What helped you personally to keep going, to be willing to live at the compound? '
A_7a: 'JH: God was the source of my strength. Because I can remember one morning I
  was going to the ETU and then I received a call from one of my students, that she
  had a relation infected with the Ebola virus.'
A_7b: 
Q_8: 'Q: One of the nursing students.'
A_8a: 'JH: And one of my colleagues had just died. When I got to the ETU—I was not
  really feeling fine that whole day. I took the phone and called my pastor. He decided
  to pray for me and saidy, “It will be well with you.” When the time came for us
  to enter, I held my friend’s hand, with god to pray. Immediately when I entered
  the ETU, my whole goggles went dark. And once you feel uncomfortable, you have to
  come out, with the entire team. When my goggles got clear, I told them that I was
  not feeling comfortable. That whole day, I was thinking on what she told me. Actually,
  I was depending on God in the ETU.'

A_8c: 
Q_9: 'Q: So that day, you came back out and you were thinking about it. What made
  you go back in?'
A_9a: 'JH: Yes! After my pastor said, “It will be well with you,” I gained that strength
  and I started '
A_9b: going back to the ETU.
