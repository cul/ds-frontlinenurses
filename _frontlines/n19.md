title: Nurse, John F. Kennedy Medical Center, Monrovia, Liberia
biography: Julia Kamara is a nurse in Monrovia, Liberia. Prior to the Ebola epidemic,
  Kamara worked at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center. During the epidemic, Kamara
  served in an Ebola treatment unit set up by the Ministry of Defense.
Q_1: 'Q: Can you talk about when you first moved from your work as a staff nurse at
  JFK into the Ebola Treatment Unit? Can you go back in time to the first few days
  that you were there and talk about that?'
A_1a: 'JWK: It was so traumatic. It was so traumatic. My experience as a staff nurse
  was completely different than in the ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit] because in the ETU,
  everyone was afraid. Everything was traumatizing. You would be on duty. You’d be
  at the triage, the screening area, screening patients, and you would see a friend,
  another nurse come in, infected and helpless. Because if you see your friend infected,
  the next thing that will come to your mind is, “Who’s next? Could it have been me?” '
A_1b: I always told people I really don’t know what took me into work at the ETU.
  This is my profession. This is my calling. I must go and serve. 
A_1c: Another day I can never forget was when our late doctor, Dr. Abraham Bobo, went
  into the ETU.  He took off his rings. He told us, he said, “Tell my wife to be strong.”
  He said, “Tell my wife to be strong.” This is a person who always used to mentor
  us, give us advice, telling us, “Ah, you guys need to take precaution.” I mean,
  seeing him get infected and into the ETU, that was so horrible for us.
A_1d: One of my worst experiences was when we had this mother come in. She came with
  four babies, and the five of them died in sequence. When her last child was dying,
  I remember her words to me clearly, “I’m helpless, and how can I help you?” I was
  the nurse—and it was my patient saying this. She’s just going to die, and now my
  hands will go out empty.
A_1e: 
Q_2: 'Q: How was the nurse’s role different from the doctor’s role?'
A_2a: 'JWK: If you’re looking at caring for a patient, everything lies in the hands
  of nurses.  Ebola stopped first, because number one, God decided to stop the pestilence
  he put on us. And two, the force from the nursing work, from the nursing and midwife
  workforce. Because if it were only doctors we were depending on to go into ETU,
  trust me, we’d still have Ebola. But the nursing and midwifery workforce, they were
  the heroes and heroines who fought Ebola.'

Q_3: 'Q: Any time along the way, did you feel silenced from telling your story? Or
  did you feel like you could talk about what had happened, and your experience as
  a nurse?'
A_3a: 'JWK: Sometimes I just don’t want to tell people I was in the Ebola fight. If
  you start to talk up your story it brings up—it will bring up fear, which is good
  so people will start to take the necessary precautions. So sometimes I really want
  to talk about it because it reminds us not to forget that we were hit, and we can
  still be hit again in the future. All we need is a proper system, monitoring, evaluation.
  We must be able to track. We know this. And the sad thing about Ebola, the signs
  and symptoms are not directly fixed to a specific illness. Malaria is a prevalent
  illness and carries all Ebola symptoms. So, we just have to ask questions. Have
  you traveled in recent times? Did you attend any burial of any unusual death? We
  need to ask these questions. '
A_3b: 
3c: 
Q_4: 'Q: What helped you to keep going?'
A_4a: 'JWK: We had a team built up. We already had this working relationship. It’s
  like, I need to watch your back. You need to watch my back. Because [if] one man
  goes down, everyone goes down. It was a team effort. That kept me going, kept me
  encouraged. That was the resilient force that we had that kept us going.'
A_4b: And we can only have it when the health ministry enforces action and gives strength
  to our Ebola nurses. They need to recognize that we nurses are the arm behind a
  good health system and understand that nurses need to be prioritized in this country.
  A nursing force needs to be strong. If you go to other countries, the people prioritize
  the nurses. Because we spent more time in all our efforts behind patient care than
  a doctor. A doctor comes and they prescribe and he or she goes. But if I’m not there
  too, whatever you prescribe, your prescription won’t be carried out. If you look
  at prescription and care, like sixty percent of the work is left with nursing and
  midwifery. So, all we need to do is to put in more time, provide those requisite
  materials for the nurses to work with.
A_4c: I hope that we could have specialized nursing practices in Liberia. If I want
  to be a pediatric nurse, I’d be able to specialize in pediatrics. If I want to be
  an OB/GYN nurse, I can specialize. I have high interest in being a nutritionist,
  but there is no school here that offers nutrition. I don’t even think we have ten
  persons who are nutritionists in Liberia. I don’t really know if we have some. I
  would like us to have nursing within all areas. It gives us more strength to spread
  our wings.
