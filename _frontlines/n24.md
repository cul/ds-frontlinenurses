title: Nurse Midwife; Former Supervisor JFK Ebola Treatment Unit
biography: Patience D. Cooper Tokpah currently works at the Ministry of Health in
  Liberia, coordinating health services for Montserrado County. Before the Ebola epidemic
  began, she worked as a midwife and a nurse at Clara Town Health Center, serving
  as the supervisor for maternal and child health. She began supervising the JFK Ebola
  Treatment Unit in March of 2014 where she oversaw 500 staff and managed resources
  to treat patients.
Q_1: 'Q: Can we go back in time, and can you describe where you were working during
  the Ebola outbreak?'
A_1a: 'PCT: Okay. During the Ebola outbreak, 2014, I was first assigned to the Clara
  Town Health Center in Clara Town. I reported to the Health Supervisor. I’m a midwife
  and a nurse, and was the supervisor for the facility when it came to mother and
  child health. '
A_1b: When Ebola entered the country, I was still working in the labor room. Women
  were coming for delivery, but people were also shying away. Health workers were
  shying away too, fearing the unseen, anything we couldn’t see.
A_1c: 
A_1d: 
A_1e: 
Q_2: 'Q: They were shying away because they had heard about it?'
A_2a: 'PCT: They had never seen Ebola, even though we learned about it in school.
  It was completely strange. Our health system wasn’t that strong, even though the
  community was trying. We still had a shortage of supplies.'
A_2b: 
A_2c: 
A_2d: 
A_2e: 
A_2f: 
Q_3: 'Q: What kinds of supplies, specific supplies, were in short supply?'
A_3a: PCT:  IPC supplies, the infection prevention control supplies. We also talked
  about the state of mind you had to have to be safe to serve.
A_3b: 
3c: 
Q_4: 'Q: What about training?'
A_4a: 'PCT: There was no training. Health workers were embedded into the services
  just like that. We weren’t prepared to handle a case when it came to supplies--gloves,
  the gowns, the masks, the shields, the boots and other things, that we have now
  because of the Ebola crisis.  So people started to die. '
A_4b: 
A_4c: 
A_4d: 
A_4e: 
A_4f: 
A_4g: 
Q_5: 'Q: What was the reaction in the community?'
A_5a: 'PCT: The community never trusted us because they felt we were lying, that we
  brought the disease, and were killing the people. We felt trapped.'
A_5b: 
A_5c: 
A_5d: 
Q_6: 'Q: You felt trapped.'
A_6a: 'PCT: Yes, trapped. I have lost relevance in my community. Now, I’m at the facility
  level. People wanted to burn the facilities because they couldn’t trust the health
  system anymore. They felt they were part of the disease. They were blaming the government.
  I said the only thing I can do is go into the fight. People were starting to come
  to Liberia, bringing supplies, training us how to use them, how to treat, how to
  be confident of ourselves. So I say I think this is the savviest place.'
A_6b: 
A_6c: 
A_6d: 
A_6e: 
A_6f: 
Q_7: 'Q: The savviest place. So people were coming together?'
A_7a: PCT:  People were coming together now to see how to fight. I decided to go into
  the fight. I discussed it with my husband. My husband said you don’t want to go
  in the fight. Ebola isn’t easy, nurses are dying, and nurses are the conduit of
  disease to their family, because they are the frontliners. If they come in contact
  with the disease, they take it back to their family, and then the children, especially
  the children are closer to their mothers, so he seemed unhappy, didn’t want me to
  go. So then I kept quiet. I just kept quiet. Something was just telling me to go.
  I don’t know what was, just that internal drive.
A_7b: 
Q_8: 'Q: You weren’t afraid?'
A_8a: 'PCT: The nurses couldn’t contend with the overload of patients. People were
  all on the street laying down. But seeing the other nurses made me want to get into
  the fight, that we had to do it. '
A_8b: 
A_8c: 
Q_9: 'Q: Later, you became a manager.'
A_9a: 'PCT: Yes. From that point in time, I started to manage the ETU. I managed over
  500 staff.'
A_9b: 
A_9c: 
A_9e: 
A_9f: 
Q_10: 'Q: Five-hundred staff?'
A_10a: 'PCT: Staff! I had doctors, I had nurses. I was working with the team from
  Uganda, Dr. Atta and her team. They said don’t be afraid. You will make it. '
A_10b: 
Q_11: 'Q: So you coordinated—'
A_11a: 'PCT: Coordinated everything. Supplies. Make sure there’s food, clothing, water,
  drugs, fluids, that everything is in place. Make sure my staff is paid on good time.
  Make sure the payrolls are clean. Make sure I submit my payroll on time. Meetings.
  But I’m a nurse also. '
A_11b: Yes, I’m a nurse. That’s the common denominator we all have. I’m a caregiver,
  so I 
A_11c: have to go and see. And then you lead by example. 
A_11d: By September, October, November, we had to leave JFK ETU because the infection
  was growing. The pay was so tight, and we had a pile of debt, pile of medical waste
  that people couldn’t just take, and we still had patients being treated, and the
  staff—
Q_12: 'Q: It just was too many—'
A_12a: 'PCT: Just too many patients. Medical waste had not been evacuated, so the
  infection began to grow among the staff, some of my staff started coming down with
  the virus. At the ETU, I lost three of my staff at JFK, two security—four. One doctor
  and one laboratory technician. I lost two hygienists. '
A_12b: 
A_12c: 
A_12d: 
Q_13: 'Q: Ah, okay. You lost a lot.'
A_13a: 'PCT: We had to divide the staff into two. In Liberia, I’m the first female
  manager. Because I went, other females came, so I was a motivating force.'
A_13b: 
A_13c: 
Q_14: 'Q: You became a mentor for other nurses.'
A_14a: 'PCT: Yes, we were also mentoring other ETUs about the secrets of care. We’re
  using IV fluids, we’re using everything to fight back. Some would die, but by the
  grace of God, we had a lot of survivors in a short period of time. '
A_14b: 
Q_15: 'Q: But why do you think there wasn’t enough recognition for all that you accomplished?'
A_15a: 'PCT: People like to take the glory all by themselves, not recognizing we were
  all on a team and forgetting that we were women, the first to get into the fight.'
A_15b: 
Q_16: 'Q: What was your home life like? '
A_16a: 'PCT: I go until two, three in the morning, I don’t sleep at night, my children
  cannot be played with because I have the Ebola care, I’m in the ETU. My husband
  and I couldn’t have intimacy.'
A_16b: 
A_16c: 
Q_17: 'Q: But still, you were a team in the fight.'
A_17a: 'PCT: I’m a nurse, yes, but we separate our rooms. When I come from work at
  night, I go and take a bath outside while people are sleeping, use my chlorine,
  go into my room quietly, and I tell my husband good morning neighbor. We called
  each other neighbor. My children wanted to come and hug me. It wasn’t easy. My little
  son at that time, he was four. He couldn’t understand.'
A_17b: 
A_17c: 
Q_18: 'Q: Sure. That must have felt very lonely.'
A_18a: 'PCT: Yes, you just stay away to yourself.'
A_18b: 
Q_19: 'Q: What helped you to keep going?'
A_19a: 'PCT: At some point in time, I really wanted to leave the ETU, but how? People
  saw me. That why they came. People were dying. The whole team was broken down, so
  I couldn’t leave.'
A_19b: 
Q_20: 'Q: You were seen as the manager.'
A_20a: 'PCT: I was tasked to show by example that we keep going and fighting. As people
  die, still talk to them. We bury them. We talk to the family. They would cry. Got
  to keep moving. Got to keep moving. We held hands together and prayed.'
A_20b: 
Q_21: 'Q: That was helpful? '
A_21a: 'PCT: Yes. What we were able to do for each other was to create a survivor
  tree, an artificial tree with ribbons tied on to it.  Black for death, but there
  was only one black ribbon. Those who survive get pink. The heroes get white. Then
  we carved the names on the box, each and every one of them is there.'
A_21b: 
A_21c: 
A_21d: 
A_21e: 
Q_22: 'Q: So your name is carved on the box.'
A_22a: 'PCT: Carved on the box.  With a white ribbon. It’s in the museum [National
  Museum of Liberia] . If you go, you ask for the ETU survival tree from the MOD. '
A_22b: 
Q_23: 'Q: Beautiful.'
A_23a: 'PCT: Yes, just to remember us because we want to be recognized. There was
  no certification, there was no time queue.'
A_23b: 
Q_24: 'Q: So you did it for yourself.'
A_24a: 'PCT: We did it for ourselves. So today or tomorrow, when you go there, you’ll
  see the names, the names are there for the children to see. Everybody, those that
  died, you’ll see staff with something that can be recognized, that more the children,
  children, children, children, children, children to see it.'
Q_25: 'Q: The history.'
A_25a: 'PCT: The history, history, yes. '
A_25b: We overcame Ebola. And we still have those skills.
