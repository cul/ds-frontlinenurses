title: Midwife
biography: After graduating from midwifery school, Sieneh W. Miller began work as
  a midwife at Curran Hospital. When the Ebola epidemic began, she began working at
  Redemption Hospital, helping to establish the Ebola Treatment Unit there. During
  the outbreak, she treated patients and helped coordinate the response of the ETU
  with Alan Hospital and ELWA. She currently works as a midwife at Redemption Hospital.
Q_1: 
A_1a: 'SWM: When we started with Ebola, I was at Redemption Hospital, where they established
  an ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit]. But the ETU got packed, and there were no beds, no
  space. Some patients would die right there, or be taken back home. Ebola was spreading
  fast. Later on, the Redemption Hospital became the holding center, so that when
  a patient was taken to ELWA [ELWA Hospital], and there was no space, they will come
  to Redemption. We had over 100 patients. Ebola work is a team work, unique team
  work. No one, two, or three people could go alone into the unit. '

Q_2: 'Q: And who was on the team?'
A_2a: 'SWM: The team had hygienists, nurses, supervisors, doctors, and PAs [physician
  assistants]. When you enter the unit, before you come out of the unit, there’s a
  sprayer sitting there, and the sprayer will spray you up and down. Then you go to
  the mirror to undress. Take off the gloves, take off the mask. From the beginning,
  it wasn’t easy. It’s not easy to wear PPE. You have to tie your nose, seal up your
  whole face. Even if you wear the PPE for just ten or fifteen minutes, you will be
  soaked with sweat. When you came out of the unit, and you were sprayed and undressed,
  you showered, changed all your clothes, and wore new clothes.'

Q_3: 'Q: How long would you be in the unit with this? How long would you stay in the
  unit, the team, with this equipment on?'
A_3a: 'SWM: It depends on what you were supposed to do. As soon as we entered, the
  hygienist would be cleaning up. Those who are supposed to take blood will be taking
  blood. Those who are supposed to hang fluid will be hanging fluid. Those who are
  supposed to serve medication will be serving medication. Sometimes I spent an hour
  because I had to give fluid and wait for that fluid to flow.'

Q_4: 'Q: And the team left as a whole unit also? '
A_4a: 'SWM: We entered together and kept all together. The motto was, “keep safe and
  keep savvy.”'

Q_5: 'Q: How did you emotionally support yourself, emotionally, that you could then
  go in every day?'
A_5a: 'SWM: At the beginning of the Ebola, I didn’t want to work. I didn’t really
  want to work, because I have my grandchildren in the house. But when I heard that
  more people were dying, and the Ministry of Health was appealing for all nurses
  to come onboard, I said I made a vow, and I need to fulfill this vow. I made a vow
  to save life. I had four children. I’m a widow -- my husband was killed in 1990
  as a result of the war, and the children were very little. They did not know their
  father. But now, they are men and women. '

Q_6: 'Q: Can we talk a little bit about pregnant women? Did they have anywhere to
  go for antenatal care?'
A_6a: 'SWM: No.'
A_6b: 
A_6c: 
A_6d: 
A_6e: 
A_6f: 
Q_7: 'Q: Everything was shut down.'
A_7a: 'SWM: No antenatal care, no HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] unit. Only Ebola
  centers were open. All the health facilities were closed. The private clinics that
  were open, they were taking risks, and people were getting infected. All the hospitals,
  the big hospitals, were closed. Even those who were on HIV treatment couldn’t get
  their treatment. Even if you had malaria, you would hide yourself, so you would
  not be carried to the Ebola unit. '
A_7b: 
Q_8: 'Q: What did a pregnant woman do if there was nowhere to go?'
A_8a: 'SWM: They were giving birth in their homes. If you were in a community, and
  you knew of a midwife, you would just go to the midwife. There was a lot of risk. '
A_8b: 
A_8c: 
Q_9: 'Q: And what did you have to do to rebuild the maternity unit? '
A_9a: 'SWM: They needed to decontaminate, and the patients started flowing in again.
  [snaps] But we still have an isolation unit at Redemption. If we suspect you have
  Ebola, we send you to the isolation unit.'

Q_10: 'Q: So that’s a lesson from Ebola. Something you learned from Ebola is to keep
  that.'
A_10a: 'SWM: When we deliver, we are still wearing PPE. We are still taking precautions.
  We are still hand-washing with chlorine. We still use hand sanitizers. '
A_10b: 
Q_11: 'Q: So looking back at all of this, with everything you learned and all the
  care you provided, what would you recommend to a country whose preparing for an
  epidemic? '
A_11a: 'SWM: Create awareness. Let them know that epidemics can come any time.  When
  epidemics occur, start prevention right away. Once you see a case, one or two cases,
  start prevention. And nurses, make sure you are safe to keep serving.'
