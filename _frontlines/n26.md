title: State Enrolled Community Health Nurse, Connaught Teaching Hospital
biography: Philip Tommy is a state enrolled community health nurse at Connaught Teaching
  Hospital. During the Ebola Epidemic, he worked as a nurse in the Hastings Ebola
  Treatment Center. Tommy was trained in infection prevention and control by the WHO
  and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health.
Q_1: 
A_1a: 'PT: During the Ebola outbreak, I was working in Connaught Teaching Hospital.
  During the outbreak, we were encouraged to go to the treatment center to help the
  government. I worked as a volunteer nurse in the treatment center. Before we were
  sent, they trained us in IPC [infection prevention and control]. I worked at Hastings
  Ebola Treatment Center during Ebola outbreak.'

Q_2: 'Q: Can you tell me a bit more about being encouraged and then volunteering?
  What was that like?'
A_2a: 'PT: Well, really, it was not easy, as soon as people knew that you were working
  in an Ebola treatment center, people discouraged you. The stigma was painful. My
  landlord and my neighbors even went to the police.  I was not treating any patients,
  but because of stigma, most of them went around saying that I had patients because
  I was working in a treatment center. My landlord even decided to give me notice.
  I was totally isolated. Nobody would come near me. '

Q_3: 'Q: And then you started to work in the treatment center. Could just describe
  what it was like working at that time, your experiences, what you learned, anything,
  what you saw, what you felt?'
A_3a: 'PT: Working in the Ebola treatment center at that crucial time, it was very
  scary. My family abandoned me, because they already concluded that I had made up
  my mind to die. My first day at the treatment center, I was asked to go and give
  IV [intravenous] fluid to one of the Ebola patients. The patient was not in a bed,
  so I had to look around for her and I met her taking a bath. After she finished
  taking a bath, I helped take her to the bed. I tried to set the IV line and saw
  that I had a splash of vomitus on me. But I had on a full PPE, which is the personal
  protective [equipment] gear. Even though I was safe, my in-charge quarantined me
  for one week. '

Q_4: 'Q: And that was your first day.'
A_4a: 'PT: That was my first day! So that very day, I couldn’t go home. After one
  week, they did a blood test. I was negative. The next day, I went home. There was
  a rumor going around that I have contracted Ebola virus, which was not true. People
  were not accepting us nurses.'

Q_5: 'Q: Even your family?'
A_5a: 'PT: Even our families. When I gave them money, I put it on the floor before
  they took it. Many people were homeless because of working in a treatment center.
  They were given notice. Even if you’ve got money you want to give your family, they
  would reject it. '

Q_6: 'Q: You talked a lot about the isolation and the stigma. For you, as a nurse
  working in the treatment center, did that change over time? Did the isolation and
  the stigma, did that get worse, get better?'
A_6a: 'PT: In the beginning, it got worse, because the disease was out of control.
  People were not observing the IPC protocol, to use hand sanitizer or wash your hands
  whenever you are in contact with someone, or in contact with any object. This IPC
  method really helped to minimize the transmission of Ebola virus. Without this sensitization,
  I think Ebola would have still remained.  I also worked with confirmed cases, and
  in that type of treatment unit, the burden was much higher.'

A_6d:

A_6f: 
Q_7: 'Q: The burden?'
A_7a: 'PT: Yes. Because we had to be very protective. With the slightest mistake,
  you contract Ebola. I can remember one kid who was also an Ebola victim. He escaped
  from the treatment unit to the nurses’ room, the staff room, and storeroom where
  the drugs are kept. This little boy, nobody knew where he came from. We failed to
  realize that he was from the treatment center, in the unit. The child came in and
  was with us. Even touched many of us. But by then, he had been, I think, two months
  in the treatment center. If it takes two months, or one month, they take your sample
  and re-test you. If you are negative, they will give you another chance. After two
  weeks, they do the last check. If you are negative then, then you will be discharged.
  So fortunately, the boy’s result was on the way, and the result was negative. If
  not, every one of us would have contracted the Ebola virus. So the experience was
  so much. The experience was so much.'
A_7b: 
Q_8: 'Q: What is your proudest moment? What are you most proud of?'
A_8a: 'PT: What I am most proud of is we succeeded. The Hastings Ebola Treatment Center,
  if I remember, was one of the renowned treatment centers in Sierra Leone. We discharged
  a large number of survivors. Every month, we survived, and we discharged about forty
  or fifty. We discharged the survivors to go home. We took them home. And the other
  thing I am proud of is that only one staff member among us that caught Ebola virus,
  contracted Ebola virus.'
