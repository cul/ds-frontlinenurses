title: Chief Nursing Officer
biography: Hosinatu Mary Kanu served as Sierra Leone's Chief Nursing Officer during
  the Ebola epidemic. Kanu is a nurse, midwife, educator and public health specialist.
  After the Ebola outbreak came to Sierra Leone, she participated in trainings, disseminating
  information to district hospitals across the country.
Q_1: 'Q: Can you describe your position as a nurse and your life in Sierra Leone?'
A_1a: 'HMK: I’ve spent all my adult life as a nurse, a midwife, an educator, and a
  public health specialist. I am the Chief Nursing Officer, currently on leave. '
A_1b: 
A_1c: 
A_1d: 
A_1e: 
Q_2: 'Q: What was your specific position of employment during the Ebola outbreak?'
A_2a: 'HMK: I was the Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer.'
A_2b: 
A_2c: 
A_2d: 
A_2e: 
A_2f: 
Q_3: 'Q: Can you tell me a bit about when did ever first hear of Ebola Viral Disease?'
A_3a: HMK:  I heard of Ebola Viral two years before we had the outbreak, but this
  was in Congo. Thinking of Congo as the central part of Africa, we never thought
  we would have that, nor did we know that because people were migrating, and that
  because it’s a disease of contact, and for as long as one is infected and moving
  from one area to another, there’s a possibility that the infection would spread.
  I never thought we were going to have Ebola in Sierra Leone.
A_3b: 
3c: 
Q_4: 'Q: And when did you first learn Ebola was here? When was the first time you
  heard there was a case?'
A_4a: HMK:  We first heard of Ebola in Guinea and Liberia. Sierra Leone was the last
  country that had Ebola in the West Coast of Africa. 
A_4b: 
A_4c: 
A_4d: 
A_4e: 
A_4f: 
A_4g: 
Q_5: 'Q: When was that? Do you remember the first case?'
A_5a: HMK:  We had the first case of Ebola on May 24, 2014.
A_5b: 
A_5c: 
A_5d: 
Q_6: 'Q: Who was the first case?'
A_6a: 'HMK: It was a little boy. Stories were coming out that it was a boy who had
  a monkey infected with Ebola that first brought Ebola into the country. Later on,
  we got stories of traditional birth attendants who went to Liberia, delivered a
  case, came back to Kailahun in the eastern part of Sierra Leone, and then started
  experiencing signs of Ebola. But of course, stories were scanty about Ebola. We
  never had the full complement of knowing how it is transmitted and how to prevent
  it and how to manage it. '
A_6b: 
A_6c: 
A_6d: 
A_6e: 
A_6f: 
Q_7: 'Q: Go on then. Tell me what happened after you heard of this first case.'
A_7a: 'HMK: As the Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer we had to start having meetings
  in the ministry with partners, with WHO [World Health Organization]. We also had
  the involvement of UNFPA [United Nations Population Fund], the involvement of UNICEF
  [United Nations Children’s Fund], UN organizations and also other INGOs [international
  non-governmental organizations]. We started having meetings, making sure that we
  find ways of preventing the disease from coming into Sierra Leone. '
A_7b: We also started having training for us nurses and midwives, because we never
  had a structure for IPC. That was when we decided to have an IPC unit in the Ministry
  of Health and Sanitation. We appointed a coordinator who was a nurse. 
Q_8: 'Q: Is there a history of nurses being involved in the highest levels of government?'
A_8a: 'HMK: Yes. Starting from the ministry level. I was part of the case management
  committee. I was also part of the coordinating committee, because at that level,
  we needed to know how to prevent our nurses from getting infected and how to manage
  cases that are infected. We had support from the UN [United Nations] and from international
  organizations to start doing training. Public Health England. The British. We also
  had the Chinese medical team to show us about donning and doffing. It was also a
  nursing and midwifery thing because we were hands-on, and the job we do is a hands-on
  job, because you cannot care for a patient if you don’t touch.'
A_8b: 
A_8c: 
Q_9: 'Q: Yes, we’re hands. Nursing is hands-on.'
A_9a: 'HMK: And unfortunately, it’s a disease of contact. And so sadly, even though
  we were training and retraining, refreshing, providing PPEs [personal protective
  equipment], making sure that the nurses were protected, we lost 153 nurses and midwives
  to Ebola from 2014 to 2016.'
A_9b: 
A_9c: 
A_9e: 
A_9f: 
Q_10: 'Q: One hundred fifty-three.'
A_10a: 'HMK: From maternal and child health assistants to traditional birth attendants,
  to community nurses, to state registered nurses, even to BSc [Bachelor of Science]
  nurses, we lost so many of them, both male and female, to the disease. But if not
  for nurses and midwives, it would have been difficult for the disease to be contained
  because it was us, frontline workers, who were there as frontline workers, to make
  sure that we care for those patients. '
A_10b: Being the chief nurse at that time, I was like the frontliners, because I had
  to mobilize resources for training to be conducted and make sure I got nurses willing
  to work in Ebola centers. Because they were hearing their colleagues were getting
  infected and dying, a lot of them were getting scared to be part of the response.
  I had to be moving from district to district, from hospital to hospital, just to
  talk to them, to mobilize, for them to make sure that they’re part of the process
  in a way that did not get them infected. 
Q_11: 'Q: Could you describe a day? Take one day. What time did you start? Where would
  you go? How many nurses would come? Just talk me through one day of what it was
  like.'
A_11a: 'HMK: At first, about only twenty of them came. On completion of the training,
  I had to go with them, because you had to reassure them. I had to go with them to
  the very first Ebola treatment center. Some of them even met me there waiting, because
  they were all scared. I had to talk to them, mobilize them. But honestly, to be
  true to myself, I was thinking these are daughters, wives, husbands, and now, I
  am now convincing them to go and work for Ebola. What if they get infected? I felt
  very guilty. I know it’s a hard job. But fortunately, of all those we trained, it
  was only one that got infected, and she survived.'
A_11b: 
A_11c: 
A_11d: 
Q_12: 'Q: What a burden on you. What a heavy burden, responsibility you carried.'
A_12a: 'HMK: It was a burden. It was. Sometimes at night, certain hospitals were left
  vacant. The nurses were running away. You have to go to every hospital to make sure
  you have staff to work, you know? And also, more important, we were discriminated
  against. There’s a lot of stigma and discrimination.'
A_12b: 
A_12c: 
A_12d: 
Q_13: 'Q: Against?'
A_13a: 'HMK: Against us. The public against the nurses.'
A_13b: 
A_13c: 
Q_14: 'Q: Because? Explain why. Explain the stigma.'
A_14a: 'HMK: Because the public had the feeling, the perception that it was the nurses
  who were spreading the Ebola. The nurses were thinking that it’s the public that
  brings the Ebola from home to the hospitals. It was very challenging. It came to
  a point when nurses wouldn’t agree to put on uniforms to go to work.'
A_14b: 
Q_15: 'Q: So that they wouldn’t be identified. Can you talk a little about how the
  ministry—how you as the nursing leader of the country approached the community,
  approached the public to educate them? What was done?'
A_15a: 'HMK: Well, there was a lot of sensitization. We had billboards. We had pin-ups.
  We also had posters, and there were radio discussions. We would go periodically
  to radio stations, to television stations, to tell the public how to protect themselves,
  how to keep safe. If they think they had symptoms that look like Ebola symptoms,
  they’re supposed to report to the hospitals, but that also was a challenge, because
  people never wanted to be stigmatized. They are going to hide it. That was how it
  spread over the country. People were taught that when someone dies of Ebola that
  person should not be touched. You should notify the ministry. But they would wash
  the bodies and bury them, following traditional practices.'
A_15b: 
Q_16: 'Q: Who were the allies in the communities? Who did you go to—death practices
  are so sacred in cultures, right?'
A_16a: 'HMK: Traditional leaders. The religious leaders. We also had the traditional
  birth attendants who were in communities. Meetings were called for traditional leaders
  and by-laws were put in certain areas to say if you have a sick person, and you
  don’t report, you’ll be held responsible if anything goes wrong. Everybody was involved.
  It was like a standstill in the country. There was nothing going on except the response
  to Ebola and making sure people are prevented from getting Ebola. '
A_16b: We had the bottom-top approach. When it started, initially, it was like a top-bottom
  approach, because it was new. We didn’t know how to handle it. We changed to a bottom-top
  approach, starting from the community level and then moving upwards. 
A_16c: Sometimes, when you want the information, you go talk to the little children
  around and ask them was there any sick person around here? Did they bury anybody?
  Sometimes they tell you. Yes, there was a sick person. He or she died, and that’s
  the grave. And what they do is plant potato leaves and cassava leaves on the graves
  just so people can think these are just heaps of vegetables. It became very difficult
  at that point to manage, but continuously, the messages were going out that if we
  don’t contain, we don’t try to prevent, it will be difficult for us to get Ebola
  out of the country.
Q_17: 'Q: What role did nurses play in educating the communities?'
A_17a: 'HMK: We were also a part of the sensitization teams. Starting from the ministry
  level, since I was there, I would go on television and the radio with my team. We
  talked about signs and symptoms, prevention, also making sure that they don’t wash
  and bury the dead. And of course, we were treating. We were the frontliners in treatment,
  and we were mobilizing from one point to another, making sure that we passed the
  information out.'
A_17b: 
A_17c: 
Q_18: 'Q: How did you take care of yourself during this time?'
A_18a: 'HMK: It was scary. At one point, it was like I was just a few meters between
  myself and Ebola, moving from one place to another, from one Ebola center to another.
  I had gloves on most of the time. Sometimes wearing PPEs and boots. oMst of the
  time. At the epicenter in Kenema, I had certain nurses who, for as long as they
  knew I’d be arriving, had chlorine in readiness. I was even afraid of passing the
  night in Kenema. I wouldn’t sleep there. Even if it was late, I would leave and
  come back to Freetown '
A_18b: And most of the nurses who died were those who were working at that epicenter
  at that time, because having just minimal knowledge about how to prevent themselves
  when it started, some of them had to be using what most of the patients were using,
  and some of them even by just minor mistakes got infected. 
Q_19: 'Q: What did your family—how did they react to all of this?'
A_19a: 'HMK: They were even more scared than I [was]. My parents lived in Makeni,
  in the north of Sierra Leone, and most times when I moved from one point to another,
  I wouldn’t let them know. They would tell me you have to be careful, make sure you
  don’t go to areas where there are so many victims. But I had to do my job. I had
  no option at that time. '
A_19b: And I also can remember a day when I almost got infected. We were helping develop
  the first Ebola treatment center at the police training school, and we didn’t have
  a proper mortuary. There was this patient who had died of Ebola and was lying down
  somewhere, but their eyes were open. I thought he was just lying there. I was moving
  toward him. A doctor behind my back shouted, [claps] “oh, move away, move away.
  That’s an Ebola—not a patient really, because the man was dead. He said, [claps]
  move away! Don’t go too close. That’s an infected corpse.” I was very near to almost
  getting Ebola. It wasn’t a good experience. We had to go as frontliners. 
Q_20: 'Q: What kept you going?'
A_20a: 'HMK: What kept me going was the fact that I know I’m a nurse, and I’ve pledged
  to serve in whatever capacity, so I had to. As the chief nurse, you have to lead
  and the others follow, and there is no way I can step backwards. If you are supposed
  to lead, and you stay back, then you will not encourage the others to follow, so
  I had to stay and stick and just led. I had no option. Not that I wasn’t afraid.
  I was.'
A_20b: 
Q_21: 'Q: Could you talk for a moment about the connection to you having this unimaginable
  courage and persistence in staying in an unimaginable situation as a woman, the
  connection between you being a nursing leader and a woman?'
A_21a: 'HMK: These are two unfortunate situations. In Sierra Leone, generally, a woman
  should not lead. We live in a man’s world where the men just think we should always
  follow them, follow instructions, so it’s very challenging for you to be able to
  lead and survive and succeed. '
A_21b: As a nurse, it makes it even more painful. because generally, we are not appreciated
  by the doctors and by other professionals, because we have community health workers
  and community health officers who always think they are ahead of nurses and midwives.
  Of course, the doctors, the doctors always think well, we are in charge, we’re in
  control. Being a woman and being a nurse means you will go through painful experiences
  and situations in life. There are times even as a leader, a nurse leader, even when
  you have a vision for your nurses, and you think they should go this way, you always
  have the doctors, the men, because most of the doctors are men who tell you no,
  we want it this way, that’s how it should go. 
A_21c: In Sierra Leone, people just think nurses are individuals who drop out of school,
  who cannot make it, who are not educated enough, who end up being nurses. Of course,
  you know your potential, what you can do. You feel hurt for somebody to think of
  you that way. Because of that, they give you instructions. They tell you what to
  do. Even when you know what to do, they tell you what to do, because they think
  it should go the way they want it, which is very frustrating. And you’re a woman.
A_21d: These are two disadvantaged positions, as a nurse and also as a woman, even
  at the ministry level. Sometimes, you have to force your way, even in meetings,
  because you’re a part of top management. You have to force your way for them to
  listen to you. There are times as soon as you start to talk, they’ll interrupt—sometimes
  I have to stand my ground, to say no, you have to listen. You have to listen first,
  and then you make your comments afterwards. 
A_21e: There are moments you think if I had known, I’d have chosen another profession
  because of the way people look at you. And even the public. When I was in office,
  I tried to make sure people understand that we are not dropouts. We are partners
  in health. We augment each other to make sure we have wellness and protect the public.
  It’s really difficult. It is. I assure you.
Q_22: 'Q: Thinking about having led the nursing profession and midwifery profession
  through this crisis of Ebola, what would you have done differently? What would you
  want to do before or when another outbreak happens, since they’re bound to come
  back to all of us around the world? What would you want to do differently? What
  were your big lessons that you gathered from this?'
A_22a: 'HMK: I think it would be good if we can also sensitize the public to understand
  that nurses are also educated like any professionals, and nursing is a profession,
  like all other professions, like the doctors, the engineers, the accountants, the
  lawyers. '
A_22b: And so when I was in office, I’d sometimes go on radio and television to let
  people understand that there are several levels in nursing. You can have a nurse
  who has a PhD, like Joan Shepherd. You can also have a nurse who has a master’s
  degree. I was so happy when we started having the BSc nurses in Sierra Leone, because
  people just think nurses can never have a degree. And because of that, nobody places
  value on the work they do. They don’t think nurses are intellectuals, you know.
  Once we started having BSc nurses becoming first degree holders and master’s degree
  holders, the picture changed a little, but we need more of that. 
Q_23: 'Q: And in terms of response to epidemics, what would you do differently as
  a nursing leader? How would you change the system? What would you do if we got a
  call while we’re sitting here saying there’s a new outbreak? What would you want
  done differently?'
A_23a: 'HMK: The very first thing we did that was different that never existed was
  establishing the IPC system. And that I want to be maintained at every level. We
  also need to have more nurses into training for epidemics, for epidemics responses.
  We don’t need to be reactive all of the time. We need to be proactive, meaning we
  should have for every district hospital, for every district medical team, there
  should be nurses who are trained for any epidemic, to respond to any epidemic. And
  I think in a way, we have learned our lessons.  '
A_23b: As a ministry, we developed the emergency operation center, the EOC. And in
  the EOC, they train nurses, doctors, and other health professionals on how to respond
  to epidemics. The public health emergency and security directorate has been established.
  There are nurses working in those areas. And those areas need to be sustained so
  that in future, for as long as there’s an epidemic or even an epidemic in neighboring
  countries, they should be reactivated to start the response immediately, so that
  we will not end up losing so many lives and so many of our professionals.
Q_24: 'Q: Where would you have nursing be in all of this in terms of policy, leadership?
  What’s your vision, because you hold the highest position within nursing and midwifery?'
A_24a: 'HMK: nursing and midwifery. So we had to develop one, just after the epidemic.
  It will have a policy statement, including occupational health and safety, and of
  course the IPC component. That has been translated to a strategic plan, and a strategic
  plan has been launched by the president.'
Q_25: 'Q: Congratulations.'
A_25a: 'HMK: It’s a plan that is now being worked on to make sure that nurses also
  have a sense of direction. Nurses have been trained periodically. We also have made
  sure every unit has a focal point for IPC, and they in turn also have focal points
  in every unit for every ward. Periodically, they meet and get supplies, to make
  sure they protect and prevent themselves, and also prevent relatives who come into
  hospitals. That has to be maintained, so that in future, if there’s an outbreak,
  whatever outbreak, at least there are structures in place to control the outbreak.'
