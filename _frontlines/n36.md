title: President, Liberia Midwives Association
biography: Wilhelmina WG Flomo is a registered midwife and has been the president
  of the Liberia Midwives Association since 2017. During the Ebola epidemic, she worked
  at Duport Road Health Center, continuing to provide the community local to the center
  with necessary healthcare.
Q_1: 'Q: Where were you when the Ebola outbreak began and how long have you been working
  as a nurse midwife?'
A_1a: 'WF: I have been a midwife for twenty-one years. Let me clarify that I’ve also
  been the president the Liberia Midwives Association since 2017. During the Ebola
  years I worked as a midwife, too. '
A_1b: I personally worked at the Duport Road Health Center at that time.  It was not
  an Ebola unit, but it catered to the health needs of the community, especially pregnant
  women because during the Ebola, most of the health centers and hospitals were closed
  to patients. Duport Road, the facility remained open and we midwives were to work
  throughout.
A_1c: It was challenging, too, because at a certain point in time there were no materials
  to work with so we had to step back and wait for materials to come. We went through
  a series of workshops, where we were taught infection prevention control techniques
  where you have to be fully attired when playing with body fluids. So, being a midwife,
  I knew that those were all things that would put a person at risk for Ebola. But
  in as much as those were steps that we needed to follow, we still needed to save
  lives. So, we did not ̶ I did not stay away.

Q_2: 'Q: Did some of the midwives become infected?'
A_2a: 'WF: We had a colleague caring for a pregnant woman, and she became positive.
  And then another one who was caring for a patient also became positive and died.
  It was scary. It was difficult for us as midwives hearing that our colleagues are
  also caring for patients and they have also become victims of this Ebola virus.
  So, it was difficult for us and it was also difficult for family members, especially
  the midwife who died. She was well-known in her community. She cared so much for
  pregnant women and even for clients who came across her and in the process of caring,
  and she became infected. '
A_2b: So, it was kind of difficult and it was scary knowing that your colleague was
  providing care and she came down with the virus. So, you see yourself every day,
  as you leave your house, you feel that—it was like when I was leaving my house,
  I felt like I was going on the battlefront. If I’m not fortunate I could get positive
  from caring for patients. So, it was kind of traumatizing for us who were working
  during that Ebola season.

Q_3: 'Q: Was there any guidance given to you how to be safe? You say you did training
  —'
A_3a: 'WF: Yes, we did training. We were trained on this SQS [Safe and Quality Services].
  And the organization that trained us, we had Médicins du Monde.'
A_3b: 
3c: 
Q_4: 'Q: Médicins du Monde?'
A_4a: 'WF: Yes, they were the ones who provided training for us at our facility on
  how to care for the patient, how to use this PPE [Personal Protective Equipment]
  and how to remove it. And it wasn’t just one training, it was like a sequence. Every
  other week you would have one or two persons coming to talk with you, to talk with
  the staff that was working, and give you updates on changes or on new findings.
  That was how we got knowledge on how to use preventive measures and even how to
  evaluate if a patient has Ebola, the signs and symptoms, too. It was continuous
  and a process. You get on the radio, you hear it. We had organizations coming every
  nine, ten, sometimes every other week to give updates and encouragement. And then
  at close to the end of the—not the end of the Ebola—around August, September, the
  Midwifery Association leadership also took the lead to go to these facilities who
  had midwives working to encourage them and also to continue to remind them to take
  preventive measures while caring for their patients.'

Q_5: 'Q: Just tell me a bit about your life. I can see your passion in what you did.
  How did you want to become a midwife?  And your education, your family. Are there
  any mentors in your life that really motivated you to be who you are?'
A_5a: 'WF: Yes. I had an aunt who was a midwife.'
A_5b: My mother’s younger sister. She was a midwife. And it was because of her that
  I developed that passion of becoming a midwife even when I was out of grade school,
  going into the end of my high school years. I admired her so much especially when
  she’s dressed and caring for these patients. And because of that she had a lot of
  friends. When she was walking in the community, this mother would come and run to
  her. “Oh, this is the lady who helped me when I was in labor.” And you know, from
  there I started falling in love with this profession. 
A_5c: I did not think about getting into the profession because there were riches
  in it. But I had a passion, that love for mothers, labor and delivery. 
A_5d: When I was a kid, when I’d see a woman pregnant, I would feel that that lady
  is filled; she is not to eat. And sometimes when she’d go and put to birth, when
  she’d come back, she went and found this baby. Where did she find this fine baby?
  But I didn’t even know that she was carrying a child. But when I started having
  this knowledge that a child grows in an adult, within another adult. And then that
  person is the one that is to put that baby in this world. I thought, how can this
  happen? How should this happen? This must be a miracle. Even in my first month in
  midwifery school I was like going to the delivery room to see that process. And
  my first experience was like, “This is God’s wonder. It’s not man’s but God’s.”
  Sorry if I’m talking about God, because I’m a Christian. 
Q_6: 'Q: What did you use to protect yourself?'
A_6a: 'WF: Gloves and then we used plastic bags. We use longer plastic bags. And we
  had the rain boots, a plastic apron, and masks. '
A_6b: And when I went home—because as I said earlier, during the whole Ebola period
  while I was working at that facility, I told my family that I cannot stop. To be
  frank, when the Ebola intensified, my husband called me and said, “Your friends
  are not going to work. Why can’t you sit?” Well, what I told him was, “If I sit
  in my home I can’t help anybody. We are going through training so we know how to
  prevent ourselves.” But when I was leaving the facility going home, I was worried.
  Who are these patients I have interacted with? Are they positive? Or are they in
  the late incubation period where you don’t know that this person is positive? 
A_6c: I had a child who in 2014 was just four years. How are you going to keep away
  from that child? Because as soon as I come home from work, “Mama is coming home!”
  He’s going to rush to me and hold me tight. So when I got home, I would say, “When
  I come from work, nobody come around me. Stay away.” But it was difficult because
  those were our kids. When you are sitting as a mother, that child will come unknowingly,
  come and rub on you. It was difficult. But we did what we could do.
A_6d: 
A_6e: 
A_6f: 
Q_7: 'Q: So, is there anything that stands out about what you used to do before Ebola
  and what you’re doing now?'
A_7a: 'WF: Before the Ebola, to be frank, as a health worker during our course of
  study before getting to become a professional, we knew that you had to take universal
  precautions. But we actually did not observe those precautions at many times when
  we were doing procedures--hand-washing—before you touch your patient, wash your
  hands; after you touch this patient, wash your hands, in between patients, wash
  your hands—it was not so before the Ebola. It was like the Ebola virus disease was
  terrible, but it was also an eye-opener to us health workers that no matter the
  circumstances, you need to take these preventive measures whenever you are coming
  in contact with your patient or client. And so, it taught us a lesson that there
  are conditions or there are instances where you should not overlook anything. Do
  not leave out universal precautions. Do not leave out these infection prevention
  control and protocol. It also taught us that even in the process of caring for a
  patient, you could transfer a disease from one patient to another. So, it taught
  me a great lesson—'
A_7b: 
Q_8: 'Q: —Do you think these habits—'
A_8a: 'WF: But what I’m seeing now, it’s going down again. It’s like we are going
  back to our pre-Ebola stage where infection prevention, where we knew about it,
  but were not observing it. I’m not in a health facility anymore. I’m with the school.
  But when I go to the hospital for supervision, the buckets are there, but since
  when was this water changed? It’s just there. And sometimes in some facilities you
  don’t even see soap any longer. You don’t see hand sanitizer any longer. We are
  going back. We are forgetting again. From my own observation, that’s what I’m seeing. '
A_8b: 
A_8c: 
Q_9: 'Q: What are the five things or three things that you can tell that you’ve learned
  about the '
A_9a: Ebola crisis?
A_9b: WF:The Ebola crisis taught us a great lesson. And one of the lessons that I
  learned from that was to always take precautions when you are caring for a client.
  Do not overlook any case. 
A_9c: And another lesson that I was taught was that there should always be materials
  available because if materials are not available, you are going to put yourself
  at risk and you will end up dying from preventable diseases. Like we have colleagues
  who were victims, and these colleagues were caring for patients who they felt that
  never had this Ebola. Maybe one way or the other, maybe by mistake, they got infected
  from that patient. So, we should always remember that every case that we interact
  with remember that you need to continue your IPC protocol.
A_9e: Another lesson, or one last negative part, is we tend to forget too soon. When
  things are no more, we feel that all is well. Instead of being proactive, we most
  of time become retroactive. That is, we know that you need to take your IPC measures
  at all times. Do not wait for a situation to come before you say, “Oh, let me take
  IPC measures.” It could be too late. You could be infected already. So, instead
  of just waiting for Ebola outbreak or another outbreak before we know that we as
  health workers should take precautions. That, for me, it’s not a good practice for
  us health workers in Liberia. And we need to learn from that. We need to learn from
  the Ebola episode.
A_9f: Whenever I’m giving health education—because most of the time this mentorship
  program is that you only teach when you meet with your colleague, you mentor them
  and you teach them—when I’m mentoring them I’m always reminding them that we should
  not wait for a situation to take action. We should always prepare for it. That is,
  always observe your IPC measures. So, that’s one lesson that I have learned. And
  this lesson I have made it my business or my regular practice to always tell my
  midwives or even other health workers that always observe IPC. Do not leave it out,
  because we as health workers were victims of being forgetful. That’s how we were
  highly hit.
Q_10: Q:  Women were involved in the health education?
A_10a: 'WF: Women were committed. Women were involved. Even the younger girls in the
  community were involved with the health education, going from house to house educating
  people.'
A_10b: 
Q_11: 'Q: And how about the men?'
A_11a: 'WF: Men [laughs], the men, too. But mostly you’d see the women and the youth,
  those younger boys and girls involved going from house to house. They were the community
  mobilizers informing people about preventive measures. In my community almost every
  house had this bucket. This Ebola bucket where we had water. You had bleach in the
  water. When you are entering my house, you have to wash your hands. When you are
  leaving, you have to wash your hands. Every house had those buckets sitting right
  at the door.'
A_11b: 
A_11c: 
A_11d: 
Q_12: 'Q: In your work, you are working with other nurses from other institutions
  or organizations, some national and international. How was it to work with them?'
A_12a: 'WF:It was not difficult to work with them because everyone was working towards
  one common goal: prevention. Save yourself. This SQS [Safe and Quality Service training]
  is save first you, your clients, and your family members. So, save all. So, the
  goal was always use the preventive measure. Do not be the one to transmit the virus
  to another person. So, we all worked together as one team. Like, even in the facility
  when we have a case like a pregnant woman comes, everyone showed concern. We would
  remind each other when we are doing procedures, “Have you done this? Do this. Do
  this step, do not forget this step.” So, it was like you remind me, I remind you,
  and we work together to save the life of the client.'
A_12b: 
A_12c: 
A_12d: 
Q_13: 'Q: Is there anything that could be done differently?'
A_13a: 'WF: I don’t think there’s anything to be done differently in terms of IPC.
  But what we need to do is something that we already have the knowledge of. And the
  knowledge should always be implemented at the facility level. '
A_13b: Not only at the facility level but at the community level, because I assume
  that Liberians have forgotten. Yes, because if a child is sick, as soon as I see
  my child is sick, another person is coming. “Oh, this child has a fever.” He used
  his same bare hand to touch the child. So, we have forgotten. Ebola is gone and
  everything is gone.
A_13c: But for the health worker—for us, the health practitioner—we should be the
  ones to continue to remind the community constantly about this IPC protocol. Preventing
  at your community level, this is what you do to prevent the spread of disease.
Q_14: 'Q: And how about the communities themselves? [laughter]'
A_14a: 'WF: The communities themselves, as I said, community leaders need to also
  be reminded to continue what they were doing during the Ebola. It’s not only about
  just since Ebola is gone everything is over and let’s go back to our same business
  as usual. We should continue to carry out our activity during Ebola and even after
  Ebola, continue what was done during the Ebola that to helped us fight Ebola. And
  at the facility level, for us that are in leadership positions, we should make sure
  to have those materials that will make our health practitioners or our police to
  carry out these IPC protocols.'
