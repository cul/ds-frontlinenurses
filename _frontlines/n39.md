title: Senior Matron of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation
biography: Isatu Kamara is the senior matron of Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health
  and Sanitation. During the Ebola epidemic, she coordinated the Ebola holding unit
  at Connaught Teaching Hospital. She is a state-registered nurse and has a masters
  in public administration.
Q_1: 'Q: What was your position during the Ebola epidemic?'
A_1a: 'IK: I’m a senior matron, Ministry of Health and Sanitation, and I was coordinating
  the Ebola holding cell, holding unit, at Connaught Hospital. I’m a nurse by profession.'

Q_2: 'Q: What were you doing during the Ebola outbreak? '
A_2a: 'IK: In Freetown after the training, we decided to establish an isolation unit
  and found two rooms in the outpatient section of the hospital that we used to isolate
  patients. '
A_2b: We started. Our first victim of Ebola was in May 29, 2014, an Egyptian who was
  a doctor working at one of the Arab clinics. At that time the patient was brought
  to a facility and we isolated him. There was also rash, no hand-washing hygiene
  and only a few of us had [prior] knowledge of what a hemorrhagic fever should look
  like.
A_2c: Patients started coming. Suspected cases. The seven beds were not enough. We
  decided to extend it to twelve. Still it was not enough, because it was the first
  holding center for the Western Area. And we expanded it to twenty-one. One of the
  committed nurses came to my office and said, “Matron, you are our boss, we cannot
  sit down and allow you to go into that place doing all the work,” so some of them
  decided to join me. They were trained by King’s. 
A_2d: 'Since some of the patients were so weak that they were not able to walk, we
  organized a bucket system and trained hygienists. They would clean the patients
  and take the rubbish to the incinerator. We decided to have surveillance officers,
  advocates to look for symptoms and then we set up the criteria: fever above thirty-eight
  degrees centigrade, redness of the eyes, sore throat, cough, bleeding gums, vomiting
  of blood, cough, rash, diarrhea, and then difficulty breathing, and so forth.'
A_2e: 'We started treating some of these cases symptomatically: for fever we give
  analgesic, for diarrhea oral rehydration salts, and then antibiotics like ceftriaxone.
  Vitamins. Antimalarials. And encourage them to take fluids. We lost about twelve
  of our staff, four doctors, eight nurses, two hygienists, one of our maintenance
  officers. And a finance officer.'
A_2f: 
Q_3: 'Q: Thank you. This is very powerful. Can you tell me a bit about becoming a
  nurse? How that began and how that led up to where you were at Connaught?'
A_3a: 'IK: I was born in a village called Malikenkambia district. My father was a
  courts messenger and my mother a farmer. I came from a polygamous family, twenty-five
  in number; my mother was my father’s first wife. In 1974, we came to Freetown, and
  I started school. I passed with flying colors. I entered the School of Nursing in
  1983 and graduated in 1986 as a state-registered nurse. I have worked around the
  country. I have attended several courses in Africa, in Asia, in South America. I’m
  also an administrator. I entered University of Makeni in 2006 and graduated in 2010
  with a BS in human resource management. Then I went to the school of public health
  in Ghana and earned a certificate in epidemiology and health system management.
  I did sexual and reproductive health and family planning. I have a certificate for
  that and as a trainer for Ebola. In 2017, I graduated with a master’s degree in
  public administration. I’ve been a nurse for the past thirty years.'

Q_4: 'Q: You shared a very vivid story about the period of time that you worked between
  April and November of 2014. And the lead-up of that, how you became a nurse. What
  kept you going? You talked a lot about stigma, about people dying, colleagues dying.
  What kept you going?'
A_4a: 'IK: Well, I had a passion for nursing. I think my greatest opportunity is here
  because not all of us will leave the shores of Sierra Leone. Some of us have to
  serve, we are committed to serve our people. And I think one of the keys to success
  is hard work, humility, integrity, and a passion for people.'

A_4e: 
A_4f: 
A_4g: 
Q_5: 'Q: Can you talk a little bit more about that passion for people?'
A_5a: 'IK: Well, since I was a little girl my father had a keen interest in nursing.
  He said that I should become a nurse. I decided to listen to the words of my late
  father. I decided to become a nurse because I have passion for people.'
A_5b: 
A_5c: 
A_5d: 
Q_6: 'Q: Do you think he saw something in you, your father?'
A_6a: 'IK: Well, my father Muslim, so I think that humility stems from my father.'
A_6b: 
A_6c: 
A_6d: 
A_6e: 
A_6f: 
Q_7: 'Q: At one point there was a lockdown? What did that include?'
A_7a: 'IK: Well, for the lockdown, community members were involved. They were told
  to go out and look within their communities for suspected cases. At the Ministry
  of Health, ambulances were dispatched. They saw a lot of suspected cases. Some of
  them tested positive and were transferred to treatment centers. During the lockdown,
  more holding centers and treatment centers were established.'
A_7b: 
Q_8: 'Q: It sounds like that first period, April to September, was very different
  from September, October onwards. Those first few months were very different from
  those latter months.'
A_8a: 'IK: Yes, because the public health emergency issued a public notice that nobody
  should travel to the other regions. You should stay where you are. And for public
  transport, there should be no overcrowding. Because some were taking six per car.
  They reduced it to four. And for the bigger transports they reduced the overcrowding.
  And then there should be no market days on Sundays.'
A_8b: 
A_8c: 
Q_9: 'Q: And when was that started?'
A_9a: 'IK: In August. At the peak of the epidemic people were disallowed to eat bushmeat,
  and handwashing buckets were set up in all establishments: whenever you go to the
  bank, you go to the public value schools, you have to wash your hands when you enter,
  when you are coming out you wash your hands. It was one of the protocols. And hand
  sanitizers were shared all over the place.'
A_9b: 
A_9c: 
A_9e: 
A_9f: 
Q_10: Q:  Once people saw survivors, can you describe what then started to happen? 
A_10a: 'IK: Luckily some of the survivors were nurses, and they started working in
  the units, immediately they were much better, recovered. They joined the team. And
  so that was a sense of relief and hope to the other patients. '
A_10b: 
Q_11: 'Q: You use the word hope. Can you talk about that a bit more? Amongst the nurses,
  what did you see when you said there became hope?'
A_11a: 'IK: Hope, because for me to be able to survive over eighteen months working
  with Ebola and not acquire the disease, it was a big hope for some of the nurses.
  Because you’re constantly telling them that whenever you enter the unit do the right
  thing. Handwashing. That is one of the keys to success. Wash your hands frequently.
  Don’t touch, wash your hands. Wherever you are, wash your hands. Use sanitizer.
  But handwashing I think is the best.'
A_11b: 
A_11c: 
A_11d: 
Q_12: 'Q: You spoke a lot about your experiences right at the front line with patients,
  with your family, with community. Can you describe how you emerged as a leader?'
A_12a: 'IK: Well, I think one of my habits is to exert influence on my nurses.'
A_12b: 
A_12c: 
A_12d: 
Q_13: 'Q: Influence?'
A_13a: 'IK: Yes. Because when you mentor you have followers. When you lead others
  will follow. And as an exemplar leader, you have integrity, they have faith in you.
  You are relying, you are responsible, and there is dignity and respect for your
  colleague. So you are able to lead. And then they appreciate the recognition. You
  recognize them for their good work. You encourage them.'
A_13b: 
A_13c: 
Q_14: 'Q: Where do you think that came from? Your leadership qualities. Where did
  that come from in you?'
A_14a: 'IK: I think a background in management helped me a lot. Because managing people
  in an organization, you have to look at their behavior, positive behavior, negative
  behavior. You have the good eggs and the bad eggs. You use the good nurses as change
  agents. You dialogue with them, you manipulate them, you give and take. And correction
  should be a last resort. I don’t think that correction should play a role in leadership.'
A_14b: You encourage them, you listen, you have to be a good listener. You pick out
  the good things and use them, you see. Communication. Effective communication. Let
  them talk.
Q_15: 'Q: Sometimes being a leader is lonely. Lonely. Who was around you supporting
  you?'
A_15a: 'IK: Well, I have my senior nurses. I’m not a perfectionist, I have my own
  weaknesses. Some of them would say I like to shout, but within a few minutes it’s
  all over. The next day, even if you don’t talk to me, I’ll go to you. I will meet
  you. Being a leader, you have to be submissive.'
A_15b: 
Q_16: 'Q: Incredible. What is your proudest moment throughout this experience?'
A_16a: 'IK: I thank God for serving me through this ordeal, because I’m not better
  than my colleagues who died during the epidemic. '
