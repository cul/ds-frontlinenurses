Q: How did you decide to become a midwife?
{: .question}

JTC: When I was coming up as a child, sometimes my mother would take me to the hospital. I used to admire nurses in general. But as I grew up, I developed a love to help in the process, to help pregnant women give birth to children. It was a passion, and I still have that passion. I want to be amongst the people that help to give birth to somebody, to help somebody who is in a dying need. I really love being a midwife. I love to see, to tell a woman: take your time, push, the baby is coming, it’s going to be okay.

Q: Were there any women in your family who were midwives way back?
{: .question}

JTC: No, actually I came from a poor family, there was no midwife, there was no doctor. I can say I’m the first to become a health practitioner.

Q: Can you tell me when you ever heard about Ebola? The word even, or Ebola Viral Disease? And can you describe when you heard about it? What was the circumstance that you first remember?
{: .question}

JTC: In 2014. It was terrible to the ears. Because Ebola was being talked about in the rural county: to be specific, in Lofa. And we used to see the people dressed in the PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] on the television. And it was this rumor that if you come in contact with a person you will die; when they touch you, you will die. So, it was too strong, you know, to accept: looking at us, as Africans, we always interact with each other. But as time went on, we saw the actual picture.

And to tell you a short story, I lost my husband 2014, June 16, and he was buried June 28. Right after that, we found Ebola was already in the city. And after coming from that stress of the death of my husband, in August, in September I had to go to work. It wasn’t easy. I was afraid because my children were left with only a single parent. If I had gotten infected in the process, it would leave my children behind.

Q: How do you as a midwife, and the midwives, nurses, heal from this trauma of working on such a frontline situation?
{: .question}

JTC: You know, God has His own way of healing peoples’ minds. As time went on, I saw that cases were being reduced, things were returning to normal. When we left Island Clinic, I was assigned to the transfer unit. We couldn’t even communicate. They were very, very rigid, not allowing us to share anything in common. But we are Liberians. So as time went on we came back to doing our normal work.

You know that sometimes, when the mother is full, and the baby is trying to come, the woman expels the baby at the entrance of the hospital. Now the woman enters the labor room. You wouldn’t want the baby to fall, so you grab the baby with one hand, and ask for a glove or what have you, you go use disinfectant. But God has been good to our area.

Q: What are the lessons learned from you as a midwife, and your colleagues, that you would want others to know, or you want in preparation so we can be better responders? What are the things that you saw that you thought were good, what would you do differently?
{: .question}

JTC: First, I would want to say thank you to the international community that actually came to our aid. Because it wouldn’t have been possible for us to fight against Ebola alone; we never had the materials to work with. So, it is always good, like the saying goes, prepare for peace in time of war. And these epidemic diseases can occur anytime, especially when from the onset we bury people, the virus does not die. We need to prepare ahead of time.

Q: Are there things where you work now that keep nurses and midwives prepared?
{: .question}

JTC: We are not really prepared. In the absence of Ebola, medical supplies are not just available. Generally, all the hospitals in Liberia, especially the government facilities, we are out of almost everything. For the past six months, I have been in the delivery room. We have people come [unclear], eclamptic patients, and they’re coming to WHO, anybody who is an eclamptic patient within twenty-four hours you need to deliver the baby by caesarean section to save both the mother and the baby. But we do not have material to work with. Even a spinal injection is not available. I’m telling you reality. I’m not saying it because I want people to come and help, but it’s the reality that I am seeing. We are out of almost everything.

Q: So, be prepared, right? That’s your saying. Do you feel like there have been ways to recognize the contributions of nurses and midwives around Ebola? Have there been things here in Liberia, or in the region, to recognize what nurses and midwives did during the epidemic?
{: .question}

JTC: I don’t know about other countries, but Liberia is a country where the people who do the actual work are not recognized. We work, we put our lives on the line, [and] some nurses died in the process. At the time, people came on the air and said it was due to the negligence of nurses that killed them.

Q: One last question. Are there connections between your being a woman and your being a midwife?
{: .question}

JTC: Well, you know, I grew up as a girl before becoming a woman, before even becoming a midwife. For me, I feel for women, especially women who lost their lives in giving birth to children. And African women believe in having children, even when they have many children they still want more. Especially women who are not educated. Midwives are the least considered people in a medical setting in Liberia. We are always overlooked. But for me it’s my passion. It doesn’t matter.

Q: Is your experience being a midwife that doctors listen and respect your views?
{: .question}

JTC: Generally the doctors that I’ve been working with, they listen to us. Because mainly, the midwife should know what she’s doing. When we say the woman cannot pass the baby, they will listen.

Q: And was that somewhat similar during Ebola? That people worked as a team?
{: .question}

JTC: Yes. People worked as a team. Doctors, nurses, PAs, nurse’s aides, everybody was a team.
