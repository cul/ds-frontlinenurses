Q: When did you first hear the words “Ebola Viral Disease”? Can you remember the first time as a nurse that you heard that there was a disease called this?
{: .question}

VIR: My first time hearing about Ebola disease was in 2014. I heard of Ebola from Lofa, and that it was coming to the city of Monrovia. I had one of my nurses that worked at the emergency room come to Redemption Hospital, but we didn’t know that it was Ebola, and she contracted the virus. It began to spread within the whole hospital. A lot of people contracted the virus in the beginning, even a doctor, a foreign doctor from Uganda. He contracted the virus and he died. When we learned that it was Ebola, everybody began to take precautions.

By the time WHO [World Health Organization] came, there were a lot of people with Ebola. There was an outbreak in the city of Monrovia, and they decided to call us for a meeting. They told us that this virus can kill and how this virus operates within animals and within human beings. They began to lecture us and brought equipment for us to work with and people to train us. We saw that our people were dying. As mothers, we felt that all the children in the ward were our children, and we felt that the entire ward was our family. We saw that when it can go to another family, it can transfer to our family. So, we decided to rise up. We began to come together, to be united as women, and nurses, and we gave ourselves to WHO to train us to fight Ebola.

Q: Can you describe what it was like to go into an Ebola Treatment Unit?
{: .question}

VIR: We felt we were going in for a mission. So, the doctor, the whole team would go in as a team, and we would dress as a team. We put a mirror on the wall, always hanging. We made sure to dress with someone monitoring us to make sure there were no openings in our PPE [Personal Protective Equipment]. Everything had to be sealed up. Then we would look at ourselves in the mirror, and would make sure that we dressed properly. Before we went in, we would hold each and every one of our hands and give ourselves to God. We prayed as a team. We prayed as a team before going in.

Q: Who was on the team going into the ETU?
{: .question}

VIR: The nurse, the PA, the lab technician, and the hygienist. We would give them the IV. We would open the IV lines, each and every one of them. We would get [them] the medicine through their veins. We knew if we didn’t do it, they would die. The doctor was doing the assessment, the nurses were opening the IV lines, and the janitors were spraying on the ground. We were all making the best of things for the patients, trying to make them comfortable. When the nurses finished dosing, the patients were very weak, because the virus made them very weak. The virus made them tired, made them helpless. They were not even able to pick up a bottle of water to drink. But when you did your best to reach that patient, make sure that you fed them, make sure you got them even one bottle of water, it would ease their suffering.

We try to make them feel that they can make it, give them hope that they’re able to wake up again. We can only stay in our PPE for fifteen to twenty minutes, and that fifteen to twenty minutes, we are losing electrolytes. We are sweating profusely within the PPE. But we stayed because we wanted Ebola to stop within our country.

Q: How did your family deal with the crisis and your work?
{: .question}

VIR: When Ebola came, my husband was a hypertension patient, and everywhere within Monrovia the hospitals didn’t want to take anybody. They said it was Ebola. And because of Ebola, my husband began to worry, because he’s a hypertensive patient, and worrying will increase the hypertension. He needed O2, oxygen. He went to  another hospital. They didn’t want to take us. We went to  another hospital. No one want[ed] to take us. They said it was Ebola. I said, “No, it is not Ebola. If it’s Ebola, this is my ID card. I’m a nurse! I would have died, or I would have contracted the virus, but this is hypertension. Help me!” They were nowhere to help. When we got to Mawah in Vai Town, there was a clinic that I knew. But it was too late.

So I was grieving when Ebola started, the outbreak getting rampant within Monrovia. I said to myself, even though my husband died, I must go into the ETU to work. So I must leave my children, my four children. The youngest one was six, the next one was eight, next one was twelve, and the oldest was eighteen. They began to obey me when I started doing my Ebola work. When I would come home later, I would tell them to put my water on the stove to get hot, and leave it on the porch, in the corner. Then, bring my clothes outside that I would wear when I came home.

When I would come home, when they heard my voice, no one was allowed to run to me. Nobody could run to me to embrace me. No. They would remain in the house until I knocked and said, “Open the door.” When I would come home from work I would take my water off the fire and go in the back of the house, take a good bath, wash my uniform with chlorine and hang it up. Then I would knock on the door. Then they would open the door. As a mother, I go in but I wouldn’t sit close to them. If they wanted anything, I would tell them, “Go and get it in the house.” My children understood what was going on.

Q: If you were asked to tell another country facing an epidemic, to tell the Ministry of Health an epidemic’s coming, what would be the parts that you would tell them to make sure to do for the nurses?
{: .question}

VIR: We need to encourage the nurses, motivate the nurses, see that their needs are met, because the nurses make something happen when they gather together. Because when there is no doctor, there’s a nurse there that represents the doctor. And when the doctor comes, the nurse informs the doctor.
