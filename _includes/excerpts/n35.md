Q: So, welcome to this discussion. I want us to feel free, feel relaxed, and share the experiences that you went through this period when we had Ebola in the country. Let me just start by knowing who you are.
{: .question}

NBC: I’m a nurse educator and a nursing officer presently at Government Hospital and also giving a helping hand at the faculty of nursing inside COMAHS [College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences].

Q: When this tragedy happened—the advent of Ebola, when it started—how did you know about it?
{: .question}

NBC: Well, at first when it started, we didn’t know that it was Ebola until a lady, a woman—according to the story a woman went to visit relatives in a neighboring country, Guinea. And there, the family was sick and she assisted them. Upon her return again to Freetown—not to Freetown, the Provinces—she also had an attack. She died. Why it wasn’t investigated to find out whether it was Ebola, who knows? Until after two more relatives in the same home died. And that got an alarm for them to investigate the cause of death. After that, the outbreak came slowly and silently, gradually building up to a burst of cases in late May and early June in 2014. I think—can I just get my memories back? [papers shuffle] Yes, in 2014.

After that dramatic incident, here was a cause to investigate. It was revealed that the family in that Guinea, a neighboring country, was having Ebola. It was traced and confirmed that it was Ebola.

But at that time the government viewed the expansion of cases as political. “Oh no, it is not Ebola.” They just wanted to keep people with them. Not until April did the county then step up vigilance for important cases. When two members of that same family died from the Ebola Virus Disease, after that the WHO [World Health Organization] confirmed this.

It started in the southeast. A vigilance team was created. People should not travel from one town to another. In public places, people should not be gathered, no public functions. Until this thing started spreading, people were still traveling. This is how it spread into the east, which is Freetown.

Q: Now, when the number of cases were increasing, what did the government do?
{: .question}

NBC: Well, other health workers and professionals from other countries came and said that people were dying—especially one prominent doctor who was attached at Kenema or Kailahun, Dr. Khan, died and two other prominent doctors again followed. That was when the government thought: “Oh, we are now losing prominent people.” Other people from government, other international partners came to help us. And surveillance teams were strengthened. IPC supporters helped us to put that in place for us to know what has to be done and how to go about it, so that we can protect ourselves, the community, and the patients we are having contact with. At first, there was not enough PPE, Personal Protection Equipment. The country was lacking, to be honest.

Q: You didn’t have enough of those materials?
{: .question}

NBC: No. Because for gloves, the ordinary gloves we were using were a problem. We had not faced this type of situation when I was in nursing school.

Q: It was really the first time—
{: .question}

NBC: Yes, the first time.

Q: That the country experienced this and it was also the first time that most of you were actually exposed to this type of tragedy. So, what was your role in terms of care provision and managing the situation, I should say?
{: .question}

NBC: There was an emergency meeting, and the Chief Nursing Officers chose some nurses to be supervisors in most of the hospitals. I was fortunate to be a supervisor at my own hospital, supervising the nurses so that they would not become infected. Supervising them how to do handwashing; also teaching them about PPE, Personal Protection Equipment, how to prepare themselves when they receive a patient, whether that patient has Ebola or not; to see that the hospital is in good hygienic condition; to see to the welfare of the nurses and how the nurses are doing their work. I was one of the supervisors.

But as time went by, the cases kept increasing. I was then trained again and sent by WHO [World Health Organization] to Moyamba to go and teach the community and also the nurses at one Ebola center how to prevent themselves from becoming infected. That was my role.

Q: So, you were being taught and prepared for the supervisory role that you were—
{: .question}

NBC: Yes, yes.

Q: Given. What type of information were you being taught? What were the things that you were supposed to be doing and things that you were not supposed to be doing?
{: .question}

NBC: Well, when I went to the Kerry Town, we were trained again by the internationals that came to assist us. We were taught how to put on the PPE and how to surveil cases. Then the response when there is a case—because when there is a case, they will alert the center that we are coming with five or so patients, so be ready. So, I’d get my nurses alert, everything to put in place. “See that? What should be in the center there to be ready to collect information and to take care of the patients?” We were taught how to analyze as a supervisor.  I usually would go inside the unit or ward to see how my nurses are performing so that they would not become infected. If, for instance, they forgot, I’d be there to alert them, “No, don’t do this. If you do this or you should miss this, you’ll become infected.”

Q:  How did you mobilize the communities? You said you went to Kenema—
{: .question}

NBC: To Moyamba. We were all there to facilitate the training. They needed community workers, they needed nurses to know how to do their job, their dos and don’ts.

Q: What exactly were you teaching the communities?
{: .question}

NBC: We taught them the signs and symptoms of Ebola, how to put on PPE, how to do hand washing whenever they come in contact with body fluid and vomit from patients, then how to put on the PPE and how to remove it so that they don’t become infected. Because the non-health staff are also going in the center and in the ward to clean, you also have to teach them how to do this cleaning without becoming infected.

Q: Did you have enough resources for managing the situations of different cases?
{: .question}

NBC: At Giema there were not enough resources to be honest. The nurses would say, “I’m not going to touch that patient if I’m gloveless.” And then you’re nervous. Everybody at that time was scared. They would not touch patients without proper PPE. That was one of our challenges at that time. But, when people started donating from different countries, it was better for the protective gears. For Kerry Town there were enough. We did not have a problem.

Q: You didn’t?
{: .question}

NBC: There were enough materials. And even incentives were given to us that we appreciated.

Q: What were the incentives? In the form of money?
{: .question}

NBC: Yes, money, but we also had two meals per day at Kerry Town, breakfast and lunch, because there were three shifts--the morning, afternoon, and the night shift.

Q: So, from your interaction with the patients, what sort of experience did that bring to you? How did you feel about the whole tragedy?
{: .question}

NBC: The whole tragedy for some patients, you would see that the whole family would have been wiped off. In some instances, the children, the father had been wiped off by the Ebola virus, only the mother remained. In others, the mother and the children were wiped off, only the head of the family, the father, remained. These stories are so pathetic. Somebody would be there, crying, “Oh, where’s my mother? Where’s my sister? I’m dying.” So, we assured her  “You’re not dying. Just keep on the faith and we can do what we are able to do to make you survive.”

And for me also, my mother would say, “Hey, make sure when you’re from that center, you clean your gear before entering my house.” I said, “We are being taught. And I know by the grace of Allah, nothing will befall me —

Q: Yes—
{: .question}

NBC: So, whenever I come to my house, I make sure I take off everything that day, undress on the veranda before the children would come, say, “Hey, Mommy,” and hug me. I would say, “No, wait until I have my bath before you come to me.”

At first my husband was against my working. I said, “No, I’m going to serve my country. This is the time I should show my loyalty to my country. If I become afraid of this dreadful situation, then what made me become a nurse? Please.” So, I had to involve his elder brother and the other brother who said, “Allow her to serve her country, please.” And my husband finally agreed.

Q: It was not easy. So, how did you work with people from outside the country? The people who came to help you, how was their input coordinated?
{: .question}

NBC: We worked amicably. They would come, organize a workshop and training, to see how we are going about our own procedures. Their procedures would combine with ours, and teaching would go on before we worked with them. If not for the international intervention, I wonder where we would be at that time. We alone were not able to manage our situation.

Q: Do you remember some of the organizations that you worked with or that supported, for example, the activities at the centers where you were?
{: .question}

NBC: Save the Children from different countries came. Colleagues from America, England, maybe from Canada. But it was Save the Children that manned the Kerry Town station, in partnership with the WHO.

Q: Now, what do you think you managed to do well, despite the challenges during that time? What were the things that you learned that you did well?
{: .question}

NBC: To be honest, there was no proper data collection. Data collection remains one of our challenges, record keeping too. Infection Prevention Control is still also a challenge. It was during this Ebola virus that we were taught properly how to do handwashing. And because of this situation, we are able now to clean all of our personal protective equipment. We are now aware that we should dress properly before touching any type of patient, what you should do and not do. It was the Ebola crisis that brought awareness of how to manage and take care of patients properly.

Q: How do you think the community is still behaving in terms of sticking to some of the messages that they were taught?
{: .question}

NBC: It is really difficult. During sensitization, you’d see handwashing stations. But now because the outbreak is no more, they are neglected. Some people are compliant. But others are not. It is not easy.

Q: So, if you have to tell us, some of the nurses from other countries who may not have experienced the Ebola or any epidemic, what message would you share about your leadership role in the epidemic as a frontline worker?
{: .question}

NBC: Well, I would say, “Nurse, if you have gone through training, you should not be afraid to be a leader and role model, because of what we are taught and believe we put in practice. And you should have confidence.” Most of the nurses in the front line had little or no knowledge, and so no confidence in working. They got themselves infected. But with my own experience that I had during the Ebola crisis, I know I will work anywhere with any epidemic diseases.

I will not be afraid. I will be vigilant. Once I have been trained and I have knowledge, I want to extend my knowledge and put my training into practice. So, I think [laughs] I will be a champion. [laughs]
