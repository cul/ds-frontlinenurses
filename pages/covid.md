### Coming Soon

Like their counterparts in western Africa during Ebola, the New York City COVID-19 nurses contended with a frightening and uncontrolled public health crisis, a disease with no defined treatment, significant challenges to public understanding and community relations, and a failed national strategy for response.  As in the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, COVID-19 nurses in New York City gave care when personal protective equipment was inadequate.  
 
The stories of the NYC COVID-19 nurses can help us to understand the critical role of nurses in responding to emergency outbreaks.  In fall 2020, and in collaboration with the Columbia Center for Oral History Research, we are conducting interviews with New York City nurses who participated in the emergency response to the initial COVID-19 outbreak.  These interviews will be published on the frontlinenurses.org website in spring 2021.
