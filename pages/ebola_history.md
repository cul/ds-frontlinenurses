From 2014 through 2016, an epidemic of Ebola virus disease unprecedented
in scale swept through West Africa. As the largest Ebola outbreak in
history and the first to affect urban areas[^1], the epidemic quickly
spread across multiple international borders and became a major global
health emergency. A total of 28,616 confirmed and suspected Ebola cases
were recorded in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the disease
resulted in at least 11,310 deaths in those countries.[^2] The
devastation caused by the virus sparked widespread fear throughout West
Africa, while numerous factors including cultural practices and
histories of conflict in the region contributed to the complexity of the
crisis.[^3]

The oral histories collected in this project contain the recommendations
and wisdom of frontline nurses and midwives who cared for the sick in
one of the deadliest global health disasters in modern times. This essay
seeks to contextualize those recommendations within the history of the
region and the specific virulence of this disease, and to explore the
diverse factors that contributed to the spread of the disease.[^4]

## Regional Context

### Legacies of Conflict

When the Ebola outbreak struck Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2014, the
countries were still facing the aftermath of years of civil war and
armed conflict that left the populations of both countries with weakened
infrastructure and damaged faith in their respective governments. In
Liberia, a military coup sparked the first civil war. The
conflict took place from 1989 to 1997, leading to the deaths
approximately 250,000 people[^5] and displacing a further 750,000. A
second civil war broke out in 1999, further destabilizing the region.
The UN assumed peacekeeping and reintegration efforts in 2003.[^6] In
Sierra Leone, a civil war erupted in 1991, where successive military
coups resulted in one of the most intense and concentrated periods of
human rights violations in the country's contemporary history.[^7] In
2001, the UN intervened to disarm all warring factions. After eleven
years, the war finally ended in 2002.

The destruction from these civil wars caused widespread damage to
infrastructure, which affected rural areas disproportionately and
further limited access to resources in these areas.[^8]

> stay in the hospitals, you stay in the hospital for two or three days,
> or sometimes even a week without food or without even other things,
> because you're not able to leave the ward... for fear you will be seen
> and attacked." --- Elizabeth K. Lemor; nurse midwife and Directorate of Training, Sierra Leone Ministry of Health (as of August 2019)

### Movement Among and Across Populations

High rates of movement across West Africa are largely driven by the
importance of seeking economic opportunity as people travel daily for
work. This mobility is viewed by some as economic and political
advantage, and the ability to migrate with ease retains social
value.[^9] Women in particular often cross borders to trade in city
markets, bringing them in contact with strangers at a rate
disproportionate to the men of the region.[^10]

High population mobility created significant challenges in controlling
the spread of Ebola, and impeded contact tracing, especially in rural
areas. Incentives were offered to patients and their families to assist
with the process of contact tracing; however, patients would often fail
to accurately account for all of their recent contacts out of fear and
anxiety.[^11] Additionally, the movements of refugees and other
displaced persons increased the average population density in economic
and political centers, further accelerating the spread of Ebola.[^12]

> "Sierra Leone has a border with Guinea. We have the migration, we have
> trade between Sierra Leone and Guinea. Sierra Leoneans go to Guinea to
> buy their goods. And then Guineans come to Sierra Leone. So it's vice
> versa." --- Julia W. Kamara; nurse in Monrovia, Liberia who worked in an Ebola Treatment Unit

### The Importance of Burial Practices

Of the various community practices that conflicted with measures aiming
to curb the spread of Ebola, funeral rites and burial practices proved
especially problematic. Common West African burial practices include
cleaning a corpse with water which other mourners might touch and sleep
near.[^13]^,^[^14] The Ministry of Health in Guinea estimated that
around 60% of Ebola cases there were tied to such practices. Women, the
principal caregivers and mourners, were disproportionately
affected.[^15] In Sierra Leone, WHO staff implicated burial and mourning
practices in 80% of cases.[^16]

As with many communities around the world, the burial of the deceased in
unmarked graves, often with multiple bodies in the same grave, violated
community norms.[^17] Burials performed by military personnel were often
safe but undignified, while strikes by burial teams led to further
complications in the efforts to control the spread of Ebola.[^18] The
shift towards new burial practices was slow and often encountered
resistance from community members, as new measures tended to conflict
with community standards up to that point.[^19] The government of
Liberia mandated cremation[^20] and then recalled the directive after it
proved so unpopular that families attempted to bury their deceased
relatives in secret.[^21]

> "People became very stubborn, even when they would know that a patient
> has all the signs and symptoms, they would tell you "No, my patient is
> not going. I don't want you to burn the body."...It was really, really
> difficult...like they thought we were wicked. The medical team, the
> leadership, the government, we all were wicked people...it was
> traumatizing for even us. Yes, it was traumatizing for all of us. We
> had to do what we had to do." --- Mawah Kamara Verdier; registered nurse in Monrovia, Liberia and treasurer of the Liberian Nurses Association (as of August 2019)

### The Virulence and Denial of Ebola

The first known cases of Ebola virus disease occurred in 1976 in Central
Africa. Different strains of the Ebola virus are thought to naturally
reside in fruit bats and periodically spread to humans via close contact
with animals. The virus then spreads from person to person via direct
contact with the bodily fluids (including blood, saliva, feces, and
vomit) of an infected person or an object that has been contaminated
with such fluids. The 2014 -- 2016 West African epidemic in Guinea,
Sierra Leone, and Liberia was the largest Ebola outbreak to date.

Though asymptomatic transmission is not thought to occur,[^22] Ebola
mimics other common infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, and
typhoid fever, especially in its early stages. This makes the disease
difficult to accurately diagnose without specialized testing. There is
no antiviral therapy and treatment is limited to supportive care, such
as rehydration and respiratory assistance. Healthcare workers are at
increased risk for infection and strict infection control protocols must
be followed to reduce the risk of virus transmission. The necessary
protective equipment is bulky and makes it difficult for patients to see
the person who is providing their care. Depending on their particular
occupation, healthcare workers were around 21 to 32 times more likely to
contract Ebola than those working in other fields,[^23] though the
statistics improved as infection prevention measures were
implemented.[^24] Nurses and their aides and assistants accounted for
more than 50% of all infections of health care workers who reported a
specific occupation.[^25]

The average fatality rate for Ebola virus disease is 50%.[^26] Estimates
of the overall fatality rate for the West African epidemic range from
40%[^27] to more than 80%.[^28] The Ebola virus replicates as the
disease progresses, and the viral load is highest when a person dies.
This presents particular challenges for funerary practices, as the virus
remains viable in a corpse for at least two days following death.[^29]
The virus can also remain active for an unknown length of time in
certain bodily fluids, including semen, after an infected person has
recovered.[^30] Current guidelines direct Ebola survivors and their
partners to refrain from unprotected sexual activity until two tests at
least one week apart show no evidence of the virus in semen. In the
absence of testing, the guidelines recommend waiting at least 12 months
before engaging in sexual contact without appropriate protection.[^31]

Various widespread theories about the disease[^32] resulted in mistrust
of the medical community,[^33] while quarantine and other measures aimed
at curbing the spread of the virus strained social bonds.[^34] Some
frontline healthcare[^35] and aid[^36] workers faced hostility even as
outreach campaigns worked to combat suspicion with awareness.[^37]

The first Ebola vaccine was approved in late 2019. Clinical trials
conducted in West Africa during the epidemic supported the approval of
the vaccine, which has since been deployed in the continuing Ebola
outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[^38]

> "People believe that the Ebola is not real. That the government wants
> to get money from the outside world, so they just brought a disease,
> or say there is Ebola so that support will come in. Some people
> believed it to be witchcraft....But from my knowledge as a nurse, I
> started to tell my staff that we have to be careful. We started
> wearing gloves for everything we do, we started washing our hands more
> frequently, and we actually minimized the amount of touches we do....I
> understood that Ebola is not what people think it is. Even in my
> community we organized a group there, and we started going from house
> to house, we started giving out chlorine, we started giving out
> Clorox, and we started teaching the people what to do, signs and
> symptoms, basic things about what to do. We started as fast as
> possible." --- Ramatta Y. Kogar; nurse in Monrovia, Liberia and chairperson of the Liberian Chapter of the West African College of Nursing (as of August 2019)

## Eradicating Ebola

### Dangerous Myths

Various instances of violent community resistance were documented
throughout the crisis, with Red Cross volunteers and other NGO workers
subject to verbal and physical assaults.[^39] Distrust in the government
led to rumors that the disease was being spread by Red Cross volunteers,
who were rumored to be spraying schoolchildren with the virus.[^40]

> "People were not going to the hospital. They couldn't trust the health
> system because at that time...there was this myth that nurses were
> part of the disease... The community never trusted us because they
> felt that we were lying, we brought the disease, we kill the people.
> So \[we\] felt trapped..." --- Patience D. Cooper-Tokpah; midwife and nurse in Monrovia, Liberia who supervised the JFK Ebola Treatment Unit

### Stigmatization of Healthcare Workers

Healthcare workers experienced significant stigma as a result of their
work caring for Ebola patients. There were widespread concerns that
healthcare workers were themselves vectors of the disease, and numerous
accounts of violence perpetrated against nurses and other healthcare
workers during that time have been documented. In 2014 alone, it was
reported that Red Cross teams in Guinea encountered violence an average
of 10 times a month. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) teams in the country
were subjected to violent attacks as well.[^41] In addition, nurses
faced eviction by their landlords and ostracization from their families
and communities.

> "The stigma was painful. My landlord and my neighbors even went to the
> police. I was not treating any patients, but because of stigma, most
> of them went around saying that I had patients because I was working
> in a treatment center. My landlord even decided to give me notice. I
> was totally isolated. Nobody would come near me." --- Phaillip Tommy; nurse in Freetown, Sierra Leone who worked at the Hastings Ebola Treatment Center

### Gender Roles

There has been some conjecture on the role that gender might have played
in the relative death rates of Ebola. Within families, women provide a
majority of care, resulting in increased exposure to sick family and
community members. During the 2014 crisis, in some regions, women also
had the additional responsibility of preparing corpses for burial by
bathing and dressing them.[^42] If the person died from Ebola, such
activities are associated with a high risk of contracting the disease as
the disease in dead bodies is extremely virulent.[^43]

Traditional roles also influence gender distribution in the healthcare
workforce. In sub-Saharan Africa, about 90% of the nursing staff is also
female, though men hold a majority of leadership positions.[^44]
Consequently, women are most likely to be the frontline caregivers in an
epidemic and as a result are most exposed to sick and infectious
patients.

During the Ebola outbreak, access to routine healthcare resources was
severely limited. For women, this resulted in increased maternal
mortality and complications[^45]^,^[^46] and restricted access to
contraception.[^47] Girls orphaned by the disease were more likely to
face child marriage and sexual exploitation.[^48]

The epidemic continues to have lasting effects on women in West Africa.
Though income decreased during the epidemic for both men and women,
women's incomes were slower to return to their previous levels.[^49]
Additionally, as childhood vaccination rates dropped during the crisis,
it later fell to women to stay home when children became ill with
otherwise preventable diseases.[^50]

> "But when I was leaving the facility going home, I was worried. Who
> are these patients I have interacted with? Are they positive? Or are
> they in the late incubation period where you don't know that this
> person is positive?
>
> "I had a child who in 2014 was just four years. How are you going to
> keep away from that child? Because as soon as I come home from work,
> "Mama is coming home!" He's going to rush to me and hold me tight. So
> when I got home, I would say, "When I come from work, nobody come
> around me. Stay away." But it was difficult because those were our
> kids. When you are sitting as a mother, that child will come
> unknowingly, come and rub on you. It was difficult. But we did what we
> could do." --- Wilhelmina W.G. Flomo; registered midwife in Monrovia, Liberia and president of the Liberia Midwives Association (as of August 2019)

### Maternal Health During the Outbreak

Available data suggest that women who contract Ebola while pregnant face
a higher risk of death and will almost certainly lose their child. There
are isolated reports of infants born to mothers with Ebola who survived,
but such instances are extremely rare.[^51]^,^[^52] Estimations of
maternal mortality for women with Ebola range from 74-100%, and average
around 86%.[^53]

In West African countries, the percentage of deliveries attended by
skilled healthcare workers decreased during the epidemic.[^54]
Healthcare facilities closed and healthcare workers died, straining
further an already-stressed system. Rumors about nefarious actions of
medical workers and fear of contracting Ebola also kept women from
seeking skilled care at healthcare facilities.[^55] During the crisis,
more women sought traditional birth attendants and healers.[^56] Some
believe that such practices had the unintended consequence of further
spreading the disease.[^57]

For health workers, the volume of bodily fluids present during
delivery presents an inherently hazardous environment. Ebola increases
the risk of bleeding, already a potential complication of childbirth.
For women, the symptoms of Ebola can overlap with other ailments common
to pregnancy, complicating timely diagnosis.[^58] Medical care of
pregnant women with Ebola was also impeded by the presence of malaria
and sepsis.[^59]

The outbreak also halted ongoing efforts and progress in Liberia to
improve maternal and child health.[^60] In Sierra Leone, the number of
women accessing maternal care also decreased. Among those who did access
care, stillbirths and maternal mortality increased.[^61]

In addition to the structural barriers impeding maternal care during an
epidemic, there is also some theorizing that pregnant women are
particularly susceptible to infection due to physiological changes in
immune function. The virus has been detected in breast milk, and the
placenta may also act as a "viral reservoir." Case reports have shown
that healthy pregnancies and deliveries are possible following recovery
from Ebola, but the extent of the impact of the disease on future
pregnancies remains unclear.[^62]

> "There was a house, and all the relatives were outside screaming, "Oh,
> she's in labor. We think the baby is coming. Few minutes." I didn't
> even have time to put on the gloves. She was pushing the baby on the
> couch. So I had to catch the baby. But while I was doing the delivery
> I was saying to myself, oh my goodness. What if I get infected? But my
> key objective by then was not even thinking about infection. I was
> just thinking that the baby should not drop onto the floor. I
> improvised. I had some polythene sheets, plastic aprons, and I used
> that to deliver the baby. A few minutes later the ambulance arrived,
> and the nurses said, "Can we take over?" I said, "No, since I'm
> already in a pool of blood and I have already handled the kid---if
> there's any risk involved I want to minimize the risk," I said. "So
> let me just complete the delivery." I delivered the baby, cut the
> cord, cleaned up the mother and the ground. My shoes were all soaked
> with blood, so I had to put some chlorine on my boots, my shoes, wash
> my hands. And then it was after that I said my goodness, that was a
> big risk, but at the same time my instinct as a midwife, I couldn't
> stand to see a woman pushing a baby and the baby---and I was there." --- Joan Shepherd, PhD; Principal, Sierra Leone National School of Midwifery and President, Sierra Leone Midwives Association (as of August 2019)

### Impact on General Healthcare During Crisis

The Ebola crisis caused widespread shutdowns and a limitation of
healthcare services to Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), especially in urban
areas. The delivery of other healthcare services was significantly
slowed. The CDC estimated that due to reduced services, 10,600 more
people died from HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in Guinea, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone than during a comparable period before the outbreak.[^63]

Women seeking maternal care had the greatest difficulty accessing health
services. Despite the concentration of resources in urban areas, the
disease had a disproportionate effect on the ability of urban residents
to receive healthcare. In Liberia, only about 20-30% of people who
sought healthcare in urban areas were able to access it, compared with
about 70-80% of people who were able to do so in rural areas. In rural
counties, most residents (nearly 60%) noted fear of Ebola as the major
impediment to obtaining care. However, in urban areas, the largest
obstacles were lack of healthcare facilities due to closure (35%) and
the refusal of healthcare workers to care for patients (32%), followed
by fear of becoming infected Ebola while seeking care (24%).[^64]

> "In terms of maternity services, for example, I mean, if women were
> pregnant, they were still pregnant, and they had to go and deliver,
> and that was the fact." --- Margaret Loma Phiri; nurse midwife from Malawi who worked in Sierra Leone in 2015 on behalf of the WHO

## After the Crisis

### End of the Outbreak

The outbreak did not end suddenly; it trailed off over time. With each
day that passed with no new cases being reported, a 21-day countdown
would begin to ensure that no patients had gone undetected. Even so, in
both Sierra Leone and Liberia, the end of the outbreak was declared
prematurely on multiple occasions. Liberia was declared Ebola-free for
the fourth time on June 9, 2016. On March 7, 2016, Sierra Leone was
declared Ebola-free for the second time. On June 1, 2016, Guinea
declared Ebola-free for the second time. On March 29^th^, 2016, the WHO
declared the end of the Public Health Emergency of International
Concern.[^65]

There continue to be lasting effects on the region due to the crisis.
The loss of healthcare workers resulted in a shortage of healthcare
services. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have faced heavy budget
deficits. The World Bank estimates the financial impact of the Ebola
epidemic on West Africa at \$2.8 billion, comprised of a toll of \$600
million in Guinea, \$300 million in Liberia, and \$1.9 billion in Sierra
Leone. Budgetary deficits in 2015 were estimated to constitute 8.5% of
the GDP in Liberia, 9.4 % in Guinea, and 4.8% in Sierra Leone.[^66]

Models describing the effects of the loss of doctors, nurses, and
midwives on various health outcomes show the largest effects on maternal
mortality, with predicted increases of 38% in Guinea, 74% in Sierra
Leone, and 111% in Liberia compared to pre-Ebola statistics. These
estimates indicate the loss of an additional 4,022 women per year in
childbirth. The resulting maternal mortality rates would rival those
from the height of conflict periods, including figures from 2,000 in
Guinea and Sierra Leone, and 1,995 in Liberia.[^67] Children missed more
than eight months of school and experienced a 30% decline in routine
immunizations. Throughout West Africa, 17,300 children were left without
one or both of their parents due to losses from Ebola.[^68]

> "I saw children die. I saw women die. I saw men die. I saw babies die.
> People used to die like you can't imagine. Yes. It was terrible to the
> look of eyes, it was terrible to the ears, and when you confront it
> sometimes say god, have mercy." --- Jestina T. Clarke; nurse midwife at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia

### Continued Infection Protection Control

Neither Sierra Leone[^69] nor Liberia[^70] had national guidelines for
infection prevention control (IPC) prior to the Ebola outbreak. A lack
of resources, including gloves, disinfectants, and reliable electricity,
presents an ongoing challenge to continued implementation of such
measures. Regular use of IPC also requires a shift of norms within
healthcare institutions where such practices were not previously
common.[^71]

Sierra Leone and Liberia have both since increased the number of
facilities that meet IPC standards and employ staff trained in IPC.
Regular hand-washing practices have increased, which is crucial for
curbing the spread of common and uncommon infectious diseases. Health
messaging efforts have also been put into practice to address widespread
mistrust.[^72]

By 2016, Sierra Leone had not yet implemented comprehensive statewide
biosafety training, but had identified the need for such a program. In
2018, the country launched a National Action Plan for Health Security to
address issues raised in a 2016 WHO report.[^73] At that time, the WHO
stated that the country's ability to isolate and transport infectious
patients was "commendable." New IPC certificate courses[^74] and
facility assessments have been implemented to address the need for
regular infection prevention measures. At the end of 2018, IPC
compliance at district hospitals was measured at nearly 85% using the
new assessment tool. [^75]

In Liberia, public healthcare facilities have shown greater increase in
IPC practices after the Ebola epidemic than private facilities.[^76]
There is a national program for infection prevention that directly
resulted from the epidemic, and the WHO reports a "strong foundation"
for use of IPC measures and "robust experience" in responding to a
public health emergency. In addition, the WHO states that Liberia has
made "significant progress post-Ebola in all domains of human and public
health."

Maternal mortality rates in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea had all
been experiencing downward trends prior to Ebola, despite a consistent
scarcity of resources.[^77] The epidemic seriously impeded such
progress.[^78] Sierra Leone and Liberia had some of the smallest
healthcare workforces in the world prior to the epidemic, and the loss
of workers to Ebola further reduced those numbers. In addition,
university closures delayed the graduation of trained healthcare
workers.[^79]

The WHO reports limited infrastructure in Guinea for infection
prevention. IPC training during the epidemic was found to increase IPC
knowledge,[^80] and those who participated in training sessions were
encouraged to share their knowledge with their colleagues.[^81] In
Guinea, there had been an increase in women accessing prenatal care
before the epidemic, which declined during the crisis. These numbers
declined during the crisis and rose again immediately following the
outbreak, but they remain short of their pre-Ebola levels. Childhood
vaccination rates also fell during the outbreak, and vaccine coverage
was reduced after the crisis.[^82]

> soon. When things are no more, we feel that all is well. Instead of

> could be too late. You could be infected already. So, instead of just
> waiting for Ebola outbreak or another outbreak before we know that we

> Ebola episode." --- Wilhelmina W.G. Flomo; registered midwife in Monrovia, Liberia and president of the Liberia Midwives Association (as of August 2019)
